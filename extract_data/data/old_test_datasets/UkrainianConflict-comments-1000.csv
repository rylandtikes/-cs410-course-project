Bullshit. NATO and EU would not go behind Ukraine's back to discuss any negotiations.
That's not how any of this works. Read article 2 of the Geneva convention.

I agree that it is regretable, but the Swiss government has no other option than abiding by the national laws of its country. Changing those could potentially take years and there is no guarantee for success due to the various democratic instruments that exist in Swiss politics."

"Well, that's actually an interesting idea. Intuitively I would think that this is a breach of the Geneva Convention but relevant paragraph says:

"I think what this conflict has proven is that Russia was not a peer adversary to the US. So yes while we weaken them we’ve basically weakened them to nothing and on that front there is not much more to gain except to push them out of Ukraine. 

And yes, all the money put into defense stays in country because we’ve been so hawkish for decades. But while we’ve been spending hundreds of billions the rest of the western world has been demilitarizing in the hopes that the US can bail them out. 

The only reason to continue supporting Ukraine is FOR Ukraine. All other things are either a hinderance or have already been accomplished."

"If the Zelenski administration falls then who is going to pay the US back for all the shit they lend leased? The US hasn't given shit to Ukraine it's all on loan and there will be American boots on the ground WAY before they risk not getting paid back. You think Americans stormed Normandy because they are nice guys? Fuck no, if the British fell who was going to pay for all that shit they lend leased? Moscow will glow green before America misses even a single payment."
"The EU needs Ukrainian natural gas, Ukrainian grain, other Ukrainian natural resources, particularly now that Russia has proven itself to be an unreliable trading partner.  

Getting Ukraine into the EU is a no-brainer, simply based on what Ukraine brings to the table.

"So it seems like you do understand why people dislike your government then. To be ""neutral"" in situations like this is to be a coward. There are no shades of grey here, the sovereign country of Ukraine was invaded by Russia. It is morally right to help them defend themselves. I could accept Switzerland not sending their own equipment to Ukraine, but preventing other countries from helping them is repugnant. Relying on the excuse of ""it's a pillar of our foreign policy"" does absolutely nothing for me. Some pretty awful things have been ""core pillars of foreign policy"" in the past.

They see the guy recording them whilst these two rapists are raping the lad, and they don't even stop!!!

"Did you not read my comment? By aiding Ukraine, you are aiding America. Read some history books, wars in Europe tend to have profound consequences for the world, not just Europe. 

The USA has spent just under 1.2% of it's military budget in Ukraine, or $10Billion of the $800billion budget. For further context, that's HALF of what the US was spending on AIR CONDITIONING per year in the war in Afghanistan. That's a very small price to pay to avoid a larger war."

"There was indeed conduct in the early days/weeks/months - prior to Kyiv withdrawal - that could've been called questions as to why certain things happened... Someone made a joke on ruzzian TV about the grain deal - and said ""may be in 30 years we'll find out how it happened"" - I think that applies here as well.  The dude conveniently forgetting that on like week 3 RU army went to ""self sustainability"" for everything - there were scraping by, not getting ready for any kind of maneuvering over to the left bank and establishing foothold in ""ruzzian speaking"" region of Chernihiv - that ruzzians speaking bullsh\*t should've certainly gotten old for anyone who cares to check reality - but I guess there are reality holdouts still who ""dream"" about what happened (vs. circumstances on the ground).

It's basically the script from AntZ - ""this country must change - or its the end!"" - where the soldiers wanted to kill all the workers to have a ""better colony""!

The conclusion - ""we have been talking about plans to make deals with partners about Kherson - but we forgot to ask the enemy... The enemy is winning - why would they make a deal?"" - seems most grounded..."

">As far as I know the UK was the only country ever the fully repay its debt... in 2006, 60 years later.

Which isn't the complaint you seem to imply that it is.  The US should have been in the war as an ally from the start instead of sitting back and making an utter fortune selling things at presumably whatever price they demanded to the UK and Russia.  Before WW2 the US was really struggling economically, since the war they've been the economic powerhouse of the entire world and a large part of that was those juicy debts.

>The US is using US tax dollars to BUY arms and then pass them off to Ukraine. The US is not an arms manufacturer. 

The US is the world's leading arms manufacturer and there are literally vast warehouses full of tanks that will never see action and countless other stockpiles of equipment.  Much of that is paid for to keep jobs and high tech industry running so that the capacity is in place should it ever be needed.

>Every bullet is paid for by tax paying citizens. Citizens will never see a refund for what they are providing.

For the next 50 years Ukraine will be a primary oil exporter to Europe and I'd bet that part of repaying these debts will likely be a % share of those oil exports or the equivalent.

The stockpiles of bullets, bombs and tanks etc exist primary to counter Russia and China.  It is saving the US (and the rest of us) an absolute fortune and a lot of suffering and risk to put our weapons in the hands of the Ukrainian's.  There is no cheaper way to neutralise the Russian military.

>They do on some things but government provided social services eat up the lions share of budget spending

The same is true of the US.  You don't receive similar services due to politics.  The US famously spends more per head on healthcare than most countries that offer healthcare free at the point of use.  You also spend vast sums of money on military style policing and huge jails instead of social welfare, gun control and sex education that would go a long way to reduce crime.

Even the mighty USA only spends 10% of its budget on military."

"It's a weird time for military tech right now but this is usually the way things go. A new type of weapon proliferates it presents a ton of problems for a number of years and eventually a technology to reliably defeat the weapon is invented and universally adopted. 
For instance

Tanks eventually brought about AT guns and eventually anti tank rockets.

Airplanes brought about the flak cannon and when they got too fast and flew too high for flak the anti air missile came along.

The tech to defeat the drones, in a way that makes sense economically, already exists it's just a question of further development and adoption."

"Not the same thing.  Republican complaints are that people are voting twice, that dead people are voting, that out of state people are voting etc.  Also that ballots have gone missing, all of it.  All of those things were proven false, in court and by Republican officials in the states.  Almost all instances of issues were by republicans, and even those were a few scattered throughout the US.  Trump himself asked Georgia to ""find some more votes"" for him.

The Russia thing is different.  There is proof that they interfered for Trump, and still do so today for the GOP.  There is undeniable proof there.  What wasn't proven, and I believe never happened, was collusion from Trump to do so. And honestly I don't believe it happened because he's frankly not smart enough to do it.  Also unproven are allegations that Russia has info or investments into Trump, though he has never released his tax returns.  People surrounding him may have done some things on the side, but all the proof seems to be on Russia just running their same shenanigans and be extremely successful.

Also proof Russia has interfered in Covid vaccine info.  Honestly Russia has interfered in other countries.  They pretend to be people on both sides trying (and successfully) creating strife.  They're not the only country.  China was just caught pretending to be some big people on socials, Iran too.  Funny enough Iran was trying to help Democrats.  But Russia has been the worst, they have broken into the voting roles of multiple municipalities throughout the country and have done more.

There is ZERO doubt foreign countries are trying to interfere with our elections.  Every single REAL AMERICAN should be on the same side here.  We can fight amongst ourselves, but nobody from the outside should be pushing any of us, even our opponents.  If you defend Russia (or other countries) meddling, you're not a real American.  If you deny that they are, you're probably just a Russian anyway."

"So while I'm very much in favor of not using POWs as human shields, I have to ask how well this applies when the other side is attacking non-military targets anyway. Like, a hospital seems a reasonable place to keep any who are injured, but Russia is perfectly willing to bomb them anyway.

I think if you look at the problems the U.S acknowledges with patriot you will see that they understand the battery style setups are not necessarily the best. It's a trade off. That said you also need to recognize that the western approach to air superiority involves a much heavier hand when it comes to fighter aircraft and that includes fighter aircraft in an anti ballistic missile role. The F35 is getting additional development to perform this task.

Ukraine has done a good job of keeping the moral high-ground and that's a large contributing factor as to why so many nations keep making military materials available to Ukraine.  If they lowered themselves to being no different than Russia, that support would evaporate."

Being an apologist for the occupiers isn't going to end the war sooner, but only embolden them to seize more of what isn't theirs. Their occupation, their military, needs to be absolutely crushed and humiliated, time and time again until the RU public wakes up and says 'no more.' 

Until that day, UA needs to use all options available to it to secure victory. Would it be absolutely fantastic if RU ended the war today, recalled it's troops, redacted its annexations, returned all POWs, civilians and children forcibly kidnapped and relocated, opened itself up to UN and Hague war crimes tribunals - that would be the ""right"" thing to do. 

But because that will never happen, UA HAS TO shape the battlefield and prep conditions for defeating RU across all of its territory and unfortunately that means making tough strategic decisions."

"In Norway we had this derogatory term for Norwegian women who got into relationships/married/got kids with german soldiers. «Tyskertøs» which loosely translatør to germanslut/slut to the germans. 

Some of them had their Norwegian citizenship revoked, and were deported to Germany after the war, and many were shunned by society for a long time. It is estimated that 7.5-25% of girls between 15 and 30 had some form of romantic (short and/or long) dealings with german soldier(s).


Only in 2018 did the Norwegian government issue a public apology to the women, and their children/families, who were affected by this.

Clearly you are not American or have no concept of American economics. The USA does not manufacture anything. They purchase everything from private industry and they pay for it with taxpayer money.

>  
>  
>You don't receive similar services due to politics. The US famously spends more per head on healthcare than most countries that offer healthcare free at the point of use.

It's not politics, it is the Constitution of the country which purposely limits the power of government in favor of private enterprise.  And in whatever country you are from the healthcare is not free either.  It is paid by taxes.  No service is provided to anyone for free, and as a result our taxation is far lower than yours.

As far as our military budget, it is what it is because we don't wear rose colored glasses and pretend the bad people of the world are content with what they have.  You country has been able to budget what it does for your social services because it largely relies on the protective umbrella of the United States.  Should we pack up our toys and bring them home as well as cut off the foreign aid we provide, your taxes would either climb higher than your paycheck or all those ""free"" social programs would dissipate so that the military budget could match the threat your neighbors present.

Also, the 3.74% defense budget of a $23 trillion dollar GDP is a shitload of money.  Thank you Capitalism and Free Enterprise."

"The wire goes from the launcher to the missile and sends electrical impulses that steer the missile. So there is a spool of thin strong wire that is a few kilometers long.

The javelin is a newer man portable anti tank missile while the TOW is older. The tow isn't as fancy and less than half the cost but still effective.

Basically the advantage is it works well against Russian tanks despite the age and the US has a crap ton they can shovel to Ukraine to blow up tanks."

"I understand your hate and confusion, i feel it too, but unfortunately these people have been brainwashed to think they are the good guys saving these poor children from an evil nazi enemy. What i expect is very sad, i think, but i would like to share my view on this horrible issue with you.

 Childrens minds are very malleable and many will forget their old identity. I'm sure they won't be keeping their own names for example. And internet acces can be censored, kids won't have acces or knowledge about bypassing it. When they're old enough to be able to, i think they'll have either accepted their fate or just only have some faint memory about their 'previous' childhood. Very few will accept being rescued or proactively search out their true roots, i think. Probably kids that got kidnapped at an older age, like 8+.

I just hope they get rescued some way very soon. And that these kids have a chance to process this immense trauma. But the brainwashed people wont change their views and stand up for humanity, so i think it's a mission impossible. Unless this reality is actually a action hero movie and the lead character is able to do some crazy save all the kids Santa-like move in one night and simultaneously build shelters in Ukraine that are save, provide education and supervision, food, warmth, etc for all the orphans / dropping them off at family that's still alive and save. I typed save because i pictured a comedy scene in the movie where the hero just pops up in an active battle and goes ""hey dude here's your kid"" and this guy is just completely mindblown and the kid says ""hello papa my name is Pjotr now"".

Sorry that derailed a little bit. Anyways i hope this is the action movie and the hero is just now finishing his final training in Tibet or some spirit realm or something. And that after he saves all the children he achieves true guru state, teleports above the red square and levitates. Then he establishes a mental connection with every russian that is infected with this propaganda brain disease and removes this dark veil that is clouding their mind. Thoae that accept the truth break down to their knees and weep. The ones that resist will feel the words burning inside their skulls until eventually their eyes burn out. And then you see the villian of the movie and his lackies at that big table where theyre all in allot of pain and one by one the lackies die ofc, but the villian himself barely holds on and then injects himself with some shit and suddenly hes immune to the mind connection thing. The hero is like ""whaat"" and shoots off towards where the big bad guy is. Oh yeah the stuff he injected also made him like a monster. Like 2x as big with chicken feet, a skunks tail, porcupine back, little rat hands and idk i guess a bats head? The hero appears and an epic fight follows. Batchicken boy gets away and pins the hero. Oh no! Hes going for the red button! Flashback. Hero is on the big mountain in tibet and hes climbing but he falls. Some rocks fall on him and pin him down. He struggles but cant get loose. You see 3 days pass. Hes given up. But then a snow fox stumbles along and ia curioua. The fox accidentally boops one of the rocks and scatters and the hero suddenly sees the one way to get out of this mess. End flashback. You see like a ghost of a fox pass by the hero. The hero smirks. He gathers his strength and breaks free from the trap. He rushes after the stinky bad guy.

Oh noo hes too late. Hes pinned him down but the button has been pressed. ""You are too late! Muahhahahahaa"". His head gets mushed to a pulp. The hero flies off and stops most of the rockets. Unfortunately, a few hundred are out of his reach.

The world waits anxiously for the rockets to land. The man causing these problems is dead. No retaliation will be necessary, only restoration of the final damage this madman has done. The first rockets hit their targets. Nothing happens. All the rockets contained bricks and potatos.

Im so sorry. I should go to bed. Goos night."

I don’t know how complicated a drone is to replicate but I do know that NLAW and javelins have complicated supply chains involving something like 15 different countries. It’s hard enough for the actual manufacturers to make them so I’m not concerned unless they actually pull it off.

"Give them long range missiles ... So when Ukraine Fires them at Moscow , or Russian Naval base in Crimea. Russian commanders will have to decide if those are NATO nuke's or just conventional warheads incoming. Keep in mind that the Russian cold war strategy is very much in play right now and on high alert. If they see shit coming at them ,they will have to respond.  You are basically risking Nuclear war by doing this , seriously think this is stupid .  And as much as we would like to write Slava Ukrayni on a warhead and send it to Putins bedside , this is just not an option. ATACMS would be seen as a serious NATO threat to Russian commanders who are in charge of detecting incoming ballistic missiles and I would be very nervous about how they would respond, do we really want to risk Nuclear war ?

"Should be coming out and saying they'll bring Putin to justice, but sure...

I'll believe it when I see it, either way. Russia is hardly going to banish their own to face the music at The Hague, save for maybe a handful of scapegoats, and anyone going in to arrest those who are wanted by force will probably have a rough time of it."

"Watching this sort of gave me flashbacks to my childhood in the 60s witnessing the culture war in the U.S. at the time. Some elements are the same: young men unwilling to serve in a chaotic war, and old men blaming the young for being lackadaisical if there's a negative outcome.  
Solovyov's condescending lecture sounds similar to the conservative commentary I heard in those days. It sounds like internal strife might be inevitable in Russia as families start asking questions and surviving soldiers begin to return. They may be running into a ""generation gap"" problem.  
I don't see it turning into a ""hippies vs. suits"" sort of thing; I don't expect the angry, returning mobilized to be anti-Russia. I do expect they'll have something to say about rich people on television who pontificate about the reality of war from a comfortable distance.  
Russian morale is horrible according to everything I've seen here, and ordinary Russians live in abject poverty. Families are not getting death benefit payments for men killed in action and most of them seem to be small farmers. These families and villages can't afford to lose their men and I can't see how they would stand for that for very long.  
Putin is losing control of everything and the only thing he has left is this ""angry uncle"" television personality who thinks it's a good idea to demoralize the troops while also trying to recruit them.  
This war is horrifying and sad and I want Russia to lose and skulk home as soon as possible.  
I hope this wasn't off-topic, but the dynamics are so familiar to me and I hope it really spells disaster for Putin."
And Russia can veto it?
HAHAHAHAHA!!!  Oh damn you blindsided me good with the EPIC/Vail Resorts!!!

Brilliant take!
"They are resentful, but learn in the hardest ways possible that they have no power whatsoever over those above them….and a year later, they get some younger boys below them and get a feeling like they finally have some power and control.   As time goes on they have more and more younger boys below them as they move up the hierarchy.  

This is how their lower structure works.  You are going to get fucked by the guy above you, and there’s nothing you can do about it.   Only thing you can do is fuck the guy below you.

It doesn’t make the team better.  Just makes it so everyone is afraid of the guy above them."

"Do not even give to the bot who made the original comment, its goal is to create skepticism & division for each videos which put Russian in a bad light by constantly spitting ""Fake, proof this is real""

While not only there is nothing that shows it is fake, the reports by Ukrainians (both military & civilians), independent sources & even Russians themselves over the months in this war shows Kadyrovites behaving exactly in this way.

Now also add the Dedovshchina culture which has existed for over 60 fucking years & the countless of cases (with video evidence on this sub) showing how poorly DNR & LNR soldiers have constantly been treated by both Kadyrovites & Russians. 

Russians don't recognize them as true Russians, Russia doesn't let them in because they aren't Russian citizens, Russia doesn't pay any compensation to the family if they die because they aren't Russian citizens. 

Then how many times have we seen videos on this sub of Russians complaining about Kadyrovites for being good at absolutely nothing except looting, coming after the battles to shoot Tiktoks videos taking credits for the fight & being there to torture & execute Russian soldiers who would attempt to desert?"

"I am not sure that these so called pundits realize the power of the lobbyist for the Military-Industrial complex. These are the companies that filtered weapons into Afghanistan for the better part of a decade, through black box budgets. Sure the Republicans will make a show of blocking things, but it will just become more covert than it was under the Democrats.  Ultimately, these military industrial companies are making billions and want to make billions more and they do not have a American-Afghan war to do so anymore. This is all just political smoke and mirrors."

"They're gonna be in for a rude awakening. They assume that American political parties are monolithic entities that vote in lockstep. They don't seem to realize that most Republican have supported Ukraine bills in the past and will likely continue to do so even if they have full control of congress. If anything divided governments have historically caused US presidents to focus more on foreign affairs. Biden will seek foreign policy wins by helping Ukraine further, while Republicans will probably use it as a ""see we can still be bipartisan"" issue."
That guy just off the bottom of frame.
"That's what Russia, Iran and Syria share in common a machine of death, terror and propaganda to turn people into mere flesh matter and obedient slaves. While the party members and their children reap billions off those countries.

"Very good points — however hospitals can be valid targets if their are being used for military purposes.  Doing so is a war crime on the party using the hospital for military uses.  For example, putting a SAM on top of a  hospital is a war crime but it also is a legal target for the party needing to eliminate the SAM — the hospital is collateral but legal collateral in this scenario."

"because that isn't the point.

the point is that ukraine must appear open to negotiations for continued support instead of closing that door firmly shut. the point is ukraine appears as saying ""look, we don't want this war. we don't need this war. but we fight for what we must fight. it's our territory, it's our country. russia needs to leave it, and we're ready to open talks with russia to accomplish that through non violent means.""

&#x200B;

if russia doesn't want to play that game, it's russia making clear without a shadow of a doubt that russia's intentions are continueing the horrendous loss of life. why does putin mobilise 300k additional russians to be sent to their graves in ukraine? those russians could have lived in peace. but now they must die for putin's ambitions. oh, the humanity."

There is so much of this alpha male tough mentality  whether u are male or female and without having to put your money where your mouth is.  Instead they post crap online or harass and bully ppl, mainly Ukrainians.

He seems very drunk in this video.
It is the point though. Why would America project that they want Ukraine to negotiate with a war criminal like putin - it sends a message to the whole world that you can commit acts of genocide etc and get away with it. All this whilst knowing that ukraine can talk to other ppl in the kremlin or intermediaries like erodgan - which they have done and continue to do (ie grain shipment deal).

A lot of heartless comments here.  This is where a bunch of you argue the atrocities in Ukraine but the mobilized are much less to blame on that.  The professional soldiers did most all of that.  I feel for them.  It's not easy for them to fight Putin because of the mechanisms he created.  If they don't go to the army they go to jail or worse.  The smart ones need to find a way to surrender.

"Putin wouldn't agree to any one of the existing conditions in isolation FFS. But having the removal of a foreign country's leader (even a barbaric aggressor country) is 1) not a good look for Ukraine, 2) changes nothing, and 3) would actually benefit Putin's propaganda internally. No one in Russia would put an iota of pressure on Putin if his removal was a precondition, but they might see the other conditions as tenable, and a good enough premise for speaking out against him. Of course Putin won't, but it's the friction within Putin's ranks that it might be nice to create."

I do admire that Senator Portman has been one of those most strongly supporting Ukraine and NATO.  Though it sums up the situation when his likely successor has sung a very different (and disgusting) tune.
"He's a colonel general in the Russian military.

He should lead from the front like a good colonel general"
Disagree. If it ends he can spin it as a win. His troops need to be totally destroyed and kicked out completely
I understand the Ukrainians had a very good day in Snihurivka.
Russians haven't even unlocked pallets and forklifts yet from the looks of their supply dumps.
"He showed me a few albums and asked ""these look familiar?""  It was the russian Elvis or Chuck Barry or whatever, it's been so long I don't remember.  These artists were the true founders of rock.  I was told not to mention this around her.  lol"

"The US sold the missiles to France, which sold them to UAE, which then ended up in Libya in the hands of a rebel group.

That’s just one case, I’m positive if Iran wanted them, they got them. 

Also I came across this: https://21stcenturyasianarmsrace.com/2019/06/14/pay-very-close-attention-to-this-iranian-missile/

Which seems to be them trying to copy US munitions."
Yup we can do that. I have a feeling Xi will be phasing us out though. Did you look up Mao’s Planned Economy as I suggested?
Yes
it is for clicks.  it draws people's attention to his thumb nails.  thanks for your comment and support of UA.

"China is crashing right now though, it seems like he has to do something. Did you notice he’s surrounded himself with ‘yes’ men, so he’s in an echo chamber? I also just heard (did I mention?) that Xi might be bringing in a new currency. And also that a lot of rich people have left? It’s really going to sh1t right now. How can you repeatedly close down mega cities, shutter all the businesses for months, reopen, but then close down again, over and over. Businesses can’t survive that. Since he doesn’t care right now, it seems like it lends credence to the possibility that he’s switching everything up."
"Advancing 3 cm a day than go back 10 kilometers.  I am thinking next months you will report Russia decided gracefully to give land back to Ukraine and Ruzzians mothers never see theirs mobik sons again, unless their sons are smart enough to surrender."

Let’s all agree with him so Russia does not change a thing. It’s working out just fine for Ukraine!
Sadly you don't shoot into Bellarus. It gives Bellarus fuck wad leader reason to join the war.

I personally don’t read Jokowi’s statement as a hint about Putin’s plans. It sounds as if he’s only speculating.
"Well said, I don’t think I have anything to add. On the whole, I think you’re right. There is the odd person though, for instance I have a friend in Russia right now. I wish they had left, but family held them back."
I hear the Ukrainians had a very good day in Snihurivka.
Sadly in six months when Russia mobilizes more it will be the children appealing for help finding their mothers in Ukraine unless Russia surrenders.

I have one question: who the hell is Don?
"I don’t know how many good people there are in China, but they’re not all bad. And they’re being dragged around by their government. It’s just horrible what they get put through. And you can’t dissent in China. You just get disappeared. So no, there’s nothing we can do from the outside, but yes, I have a heavy heart for them. And it’s not a bad thing to feel bad for others, to have humanity and compassion.."
"Gods if that’s in HIMARS range of the border it’s gotta be damn tempting.  Even then Ukraine do have some drones and non-HIMARS missiles they could send.

Lukashenko is just begging for them to attack something in Belarus so he can justify mobilisation and Belarus joining the war though. Public opinion is HIGHLY against Belarus joining and he knows if he goes in without cause he’ll have a revolt on his hands.

No doubt Ukraine will be continually analysing the benefit versus cost of launching a preemptive strike or hitting the Russians while they’re grouped neatly together and easily hit before they join the fray.

Not to mention that it if the experts are correct about it being a bluff then giving Ukraine a juicy looking target could be bait to either encourage an attack on Belarusian soil to trigger them into the war or just an attempt to divert Ukrainian forces to the Belarus border for guard. It’s certainly not hard to get a couple dozen guys to setup a mass load of tents and leave them empty in plain sight"

"Yup. The war might end once Russia loses the ability to fight in Ukraine and Ukraine regains all its lost territory. But the sanctions may need to stay in place, potentially, for decades to come. Only once Russia reckons with the crimes it has committed, and wholeheartedly agrees to proper reparations and disarmament/denuclearization should we even think of dropping the sanctions or normalizing relations."
"Not a bluff. It will invade again from Belarus, but again, this time faster and without any territorial holding.

I just think that both sides are getting way too violent with the other. It's getting ridiculous. And I do not like seeing the country head down a dark path where half the country is afraid of apparent Fascism and the other afraid of apparent Communism. When in reality neither is coming because if both sides are afraid of an Authoritarian government, then one isn't coming.

People need to realize that many of our issues we have are distractions from the real problems at hand. The economy. Wages. Corporate Greed. Tax Loopholes.

"It all started with gays:

>In late 2011, when Russians protested faked elections, their leaders associated the protestors with homosexuality. In late 2013, confronted with the Maidan in Ukraine, the men of the Kremlin made the same move. After two years of anti-gay propaganda in the Russian Federation, the ideologues and entertainers were sure of themselves. Their starting point was that the European Union was homosexual, and so the Ukrainian movement towards Europe must be as well. The Izborsk Club claimed that the EU “groans under the weight of the LGBT lobby’s domination.”

>In November and December 2013, the Russian media covering the Maidan introduced the irrelevant theme of gay sex at every turn. When covering the very first day of protests by Ukrainian students in favor of the association agreement, the Russian media sought to fascinate its readers by conflating Ukrainian politics with handsome men and gay sex. A social media page of Vitali Klitschko, a heavyweight boxer who led a Ukrainian political party, was hacked and gay material introduced. Then this was presented as a news story for millions of Russians on a major television station, NTV. Before Russians could apprehend that pro-European protests were underway in a neighboring country, they were invited to contemplate taboo sex.

>Right after students began their protests on the Maidan, the Russian television channel NTV warned of “homodictatorship” in Ukraine. Viktor Shestakov, writing for Odna Rodina, claimed that “a specter is haunting the Maidan, the specter of homosexuality. The fact that the first and the most zealous integrators in Ukraine are local sexual perverts has long been known

>[...]On December 1, 2013, the world press reported the beating of students by Ukrainian riot police the previous night. As Ukrainian students huddled in a church tending their wounds, Kiselev found a way to formulate their protests as sexual geopolitics. 

>[...][The Night Wolves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Wolves) found concise ways to translate sexual anxiety into geopolitics and back again. As a male-only club devoted to black leather, the Night Wolves naturally had a strong position on homosexuality, which they defined as an attack by Europe and the United States. A year later, celebrating the Russian invasion, their supreme leader Alexander Zaldostanov remembered their proud parade around Crimea in this way: “For the first time we showed resistance to the global Satanism, the growing savagery of Western Europe, the rush to consumerism that denies all spirituality, the destruction of traditional values, all this homosexual talk, this American democracy.” According to Zaldostanov, the slogan of the Russian war against Ukraine should be “death to faggots.” The association of democracy with gay Satan was a way to make law and reform foreign and unthinkable.

It's just wrong - you go around, and tell people it's jihad, not a single one disagrees - as a matter of fact, those who are on TV agree publicly - and yet none of them want to go to war and die for your jihad!!! I mean I know their TV job are important and except them from mobilization - but c'mon, jihand!..."
"Nothing will simply fall into place upon the war’s conclusion. The future Ukraine imagined in this essay is but one possibility among many. 

But if anything is certain, it is that Ukraine’s postwar future will largely depend on the choices made by its leaders (and by leaders in allied countries).

It is to everyone’s benefit if those leaders start to think now, rather than later, about the choices to come. Ukraine’s candidacy to the EU is one element of that, as is the subject of reconstruction and reparations. 

But because everything is still so fluid, I don’t think anyone is talking in a serious way about what Ukraine’s position in Europe’s security architecture might be once the war concludes. Wilson’s essay usefully fills that gap."
Ok but how is openly supporting a country Germany is not at war with worthy of a police investigation?
I think you are stuck in a loop
"Chips can be emulated by software, however, emulation doesn't perform anything close to specifically designed hardware such as chips. Still, software for weapon chips emulation takes time to develop and requires skilled developers that I have much doubt countries like Iran have in their skillforce since many chose to immigrate. 

This inferior replacement for chips takes them to develop inferior weapons such as those annoying kamikaze drones, but they have only use against undefended countries and poorly equipped armies.  

Advanced chips, tech development is what helps those weapons given to Ukraine make a difference."
Not just casualties. Deaths.
Zero of Russia.
All they ever do is troll.
The Russian soldiers who are being assaulted by Kadyrovites must have been dressed like sheep or something.
F him and the horse he rode in on!
"Well, there is a bit of him there, some him over there, a few pieces in that ditch, some even made it up in that tree somehow."
"That is by far one of the most messed up things that has happened this war and there is a lot of messed up things that ha happend.

What will happen to the children when the war is over? Will they ever make it home?"
So no independent Aerial Recon units like what Ukraine had (I think)? I guess this is due Russia lacked of mid-level officers?
Yes and just how do you go about enforcing that?
"Don’t worry I am working on some artwork I’m gonna draw of him jerking off in the corner of a room while crying and watching lukashenko have his ass eaten by Putin, while Iran’s leader is also jerking off next to kadyrov and telling him to wear his hijab"
"Step 1: Leave Ukrainian land, including Crimea.

Step 2: Pay reparations.

Step 3: Return kidnapped Ukrainians (this included 'adopted' children).

Step 4: Sit down at table to talk."
"Solovyov: What did you do on the training ground to be ready for combat?

Conscript: You guys are going to the training ground?"

China already had stolen the plans.

"Oh no!  Not the disapproval of the general assembly!  That'll do absolutely nothing!

Seriously, Israel's been slapped with like 20 of those things in favour of the Palestineans, and the outcome has been entirely one sided in the other direction.  This is a bunch of hot air with absolutely no benefit for Ukraine at all."
Just stop dressing like a sheep on the weekends and you will be fine.
"This sounds entertaining, you should definitely share it when you're done."
"Remember when they delivered two blindfolded Ukrainian POWs to this Kadyrovite's old dad to be used as slaves? They are all gay but they seem to think it doesn't count if they shout ""no homo!"""
Why wouldn’t they claim that… all they need is to sow some doubt even if they can’t/won’t prove it.  They win by making you think about it.
"Excellent post.  Thank you.

Trench clearing has to be one of the scariest things to do but they do it methodically and professionally.

Glad to see they got some ruZZian pows to use for future exchange."

Please post this in the Ukraine sub reddit if you haven't already.
If there was a tragedy it might be an example of tragedy of the commons.  But of course there is no actual tragedy — but the fear of one — hyperbolic conjecture about a looming disaster just about to happen — of course hyped  and co-opted to gain political power.  Just as tech thwarted the hysterical Malthusian catastrophes — tech will do the same here — as it has already be doing over the last 40 yrs

Ohhhh this is Putin’s “wunderwaffe” story arc. I’ll set my DVR.
