"I’d argue none of this is true (as far as the reasons). Most Western nations are playing for time to get their defense industries retooled and oriented to support a greater conflict.

Sending Ukraine 200 HIMARS is pointless if you can only supply enough ammunition to use 20 on a daily basis, same goes for any advanced weapon system."
And make sure RuZZia takes all of their landmines when they leave!
"This is one of many examples of why negotiating with terrorists is pointless.

"Speaking of asses, I recall a photo of a Russian terrorist who literally lost his ass when the transport vehicle he was in blew up. The photo was of a bare ass on the ground and nothing else. It looked like the skin was peeled off his body and took his ass cheeks with it. I am now past the stage of repulsion to gore (so long as it is Russian) and can allow myself to find humour in such things. I would love to memeify this photo with the text "" Hey Ivan, do you want to hear a joke that will make you laugh your ass off? Oops, looks like you have already heard it"", but I think the post was removed as I can no longer find it. Did anyone save this gem of a photo?"
Which Epic are you referring to? The EMR and game company can both fuck off IMO.

"I am frustrated too but I kind of get the logic. As of now, most of the general population of Russia was opposed or indifferent at the start of the war. With the mobilization and evidence of mobilized units being used as cannon fodder, even more Russians are against it. They know Russia wasn't attacked so it failed when the Russian government tried to rally the people like the Germans are at the gates of Moscow again or something. If Russian cities start being attacked with western made weapons, that may change the narrative in favor of the Russian government. Imagine the video of pieces of an ATACMS missiles being picked up from the rubble of an attack on an airbase in Rostov or ammunition depot in Belgorod or Bryansk. However, I think we should go ahead and give them long range weapons anyway. Those Iranian ballistic missiles are no joke and if Russia bought a lot of them, then the situation for the Ukrainian civilians is about to get much worse, especially as it gets colder and darker outside."
I agree with you completely.  Ive said it myself many times.
"I suppose Russia always knew the USA/Europe never had it in them. 

They know the West is a cowardly bunch and just doesn't have the resolve to see anything through. If I were Poland and the Baltics I would be shitting my pants, NATO is useless and unable to even help Ukraine fight so how would they even come to the defense of Eastern Europe.

Jake Sullivan set the course for forcing Ukraine to give up it's territory and sue for peace. Brussels has no interest in defending European values outside of the EU countries."

">same goes for any advanced weapon system

For some weapons this might be true, but not for others. There are lots of F16s, Abrams and Leopards that could be sent to Ukraine if there was a political will to do so. Retired general Hodges has explained that the logistics concerns around these weapons systems are all solvable and have just become excuses for not providing them when the real reasons are political."
"**Any ruzzian that is let off to escape will have to be dealt later.** It's a fact that i cannot emphasize enough. It's brutal but it's war and Ukraine is fighting for it's survival. 

Even if some need medical care, vast majority will be forced at gun point to fight in the eastern bank of the river or transported to some other front. The absolutely best option for Ukraine is to neutralize as many soldiers in the western bank before they have time to escape and possibly regroup. The fighting force in the western bank now, will never be as vulnerable as they are now. While it can be argued that ruzzia will never run out of men, it is a fact that no nation can take a beatings and huge losses week after week and month after month. At some point, something will break.

The problem that ruzzia has is that they will still need to maintain the forces over the river. With the winter and freezing weather coming, HIMARS and artillery sinking any serious supply efforts, food and ammunition shortages.. the longer the ruzzian forces are trapped in the western bank the more soldiers they will have incapacitated, wounded or killed. The time is on Ukraine's side as long they can prevent any supplies coming in. That in turn would reduce the need to advance to the city preventing Ukranian casualties.

At best, masses of ruzzian soldiers could surrender, killing two birds with one stone: taking them out of the ruzzian fighting force and keeping them alive. The same thing happened in Mariupol for Azov, with the number of wounded surpassing the able-bodied and ammunition literally running out, they will have to surrender. I really have hard time believing thousands of ruzzians doing last ditch harakiri-human waves to avoid surrender and going out with style. So forcing ruzzians to surrender because of the collapse of their supply-network would be the most humane thing for them.

Also Ukraine now controls the narrative, when Kherson is recaptured that pressure is gone. It has been weeks about how ""Russia is going to lose Kherson"" and the panic/desperation in ruzzian homefront about it affects the mental war effort hugely. When Kherson is lost, it will be only a footnote on the list of lost cities and territory. So again, time is on Ukraines side. Just like it was in Mariupol, where every week it was held gave more time for Ukraine to organize and was a stark reminder how badly ruzzian military is doing."

"I'd say before 2014 pro-russian wasn't really a thing. In the early 2014 there was pro-EU and pro-russian as a support of either closer ties with EU or russia. Then after what russia done and continued to do, pro-russian in a sense became anti-Ukraine even if some people denied it, but now it is clearly like that."

While they've proven able to stubbornly hold on to territory once dug in they haven't exactly been advancing either. Which they would need to do asap for any realistic hope of achieving even the most basic of their aims. Every day they're stuck in foxholes and not moving forward is a loss for them (it's not exactly a win for Ukraine either though). Even the most miserable Russians have the tenacity of ticks apparently. It'd be almost admirable if it weren't for all the war crimes.
"I think Kadyrov is fine, Putin likes them dumb as a rock.

Kadyrov absolutely is an opportunist who wouldn't doubt a second to put a knife in Putin's back for his own gain. But he's simply too retarded for Putin to be all too worried about him. Kadyrov would only be in trouble if he gears up for another Chechen war against Russia. But Kadyrov is also a huge pussy, so won't dare to do shit as long as Putin isn't already in a coffin or close to it."
"K, thanks, bye.. have fun! B-uu-bye.. thanks!"
"Another thing that stands out for me is that many of these people are not, in fact, Russians, the village is in Chuvashia, one of many territories and peoples invaded, colonized and assimilated by russia.

According to him, the Rashists were based in the captured church.  
  
""However, our heroic forces of resistance are not waiting for heavenly punishment, which will surely catch up with the occupiers. They are dealing with the enemy with their own hands,"" Fedorov added.

What he did do differently, however, was threaten to suspend that aid in return for dirt on the son of a domestic political rival. Yeah…that’s illegal. And whose idea do you think that was — 3 years off a major Russian invasion of Ukraine and in the early stages of preparation for the War today? 

As for being one of Putin’s bedfellows — it’s been proven, over and over, that Russia interfered with the 2016 election. And Trump, while possibly not directly involved, was at least aware of it. And not a damn thing has state involvement in Russia unless Putin has clear personal interest in it. Donnie lapped that outside support up.

>1\. From 2014/15 through to 2022, 🇺🇦 and 🇷🇺 negotiated about the implementation of the #MinskAgreements.
>
>They never managed to agree on elementary status questions and the sequence of political and security-related provisions – which is why the implementation of the MA remained blocked. Negotiations took place in two formats: the Normandie 4 (🇺🇦🇷🇺🇩🇪🇫🇷) and the Trilateral Contact Group (🇺🇦🇷🇺, OSCE, de-facto authorities of the occupied territories regularly present). Things went downhill from 2018 at the latest. In 2021 tensions escalated, with 🇷🇺 troops deployments along the 🇺🇦 border and Moscow’s ultimatum on „security guarantees“ in December 2021. This was an attempt to switch levels and force the US and NATO (after their chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan) into an agreement about 🇺🇦 and a European security order à la russe.
>
>2\. It didn’t work, and #Putin decided to attack 🇺🇦, thereby shattering all existing negotiation formats along with the Minsk Agreements. After all, they had been based on the principled recognition of 🇺🇦’s territorial integrity by all sides (from a 🇷🇺 perspective: without Crimea). In the early days of the invasion 🇷🇺 formulated maximal demands tantamount to total capitulation and the dissolution of the 🇺🇦 state. Kyiv turned this down but entered negotiations nonetheless – the military pressure was too strong.
>
>A first round of talks, facilitated by 🇹🇷, led to the #IstanbulCommuniqué, which the 🇺🇦side presented on 29 March. It offered far-reaching concessions, but also demands (security guarantees for 🇺🇦!). It could have formed the basis for a negotiated settlement.
>
>3\. Further negotiations about the proposal continued until mid May. The sides made some progress but were unable to reach agreement about two points: security guarantees and the status of Crimea and the Donbas.
>
>Meanwhile 3 developments fundamentally altered the political and military context of the talks: the discovery of 🇷🇺 war crimes against civilians in #Bucha, #Irpin and other areas liberated in April; increasing Western military support for 🇺🇦; and the battle of #Mariupol.
>
>In a nutshell, in April and early May support for a compromise with 🇷🇺was fading rapidly while 🇺🇦 was making first tangible advances in the battlefield. On 17 May, one day after the 🇷🇺 capture of Mariupol, first 🇺🇦 and then 🇷🇺 officially suspended the talks.
>
>4\. But contacts continued after 17 May, in three areas: First, humanitarian questions. The repeated exchanges of prisoners over the past months are a result of these efforts. Secondly, 🇺🇦 grain exports, over which an agreement was reached on 22 July, again facilitated by 🇹🇷 President #Erdogan and UN General Secretary Antonio #Guterres. This tremendously important and fragile #graindeal is under constant jeopardy (from 🇷🇺). Putin already once walked away from it at the end of October but was summoned back by Erdogan.
>
>The agreement foresees renewal every 120 days – we will see if it survives the coming 2 weeks. Thirdly, the situation in 🇺🇦’s #Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. This last track was smashed by 🇷🇺’s proclaimed #annexation of 4 additional 🇺🇦 oblasts, including Zaporizhzhia. With this illegal and criminal step 🇷🇺 also ultimately killed the Istanbul Communiqué and made any diplomatic resolution extremely unlikely for the foreseeable future.
>
>This is where we stand today in terms of peace talks.
>
>Peace negotiations are always shaped by the military situation, the balance of forces between the warring parties. What remains to be done is to support 🇺🇦in order to shift this balance and bring about a „ripe moment“ for real cease-fire talks. The goal of which must be for 🇺🇦to preserve its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. Apart from that, Western states can flank the ongoing efforts of 🇹🇷and the UN, particularly also with regard to the grain deal; get ready to give 🇺🇦 security guarantees and prepare an international peacekeeping mission, which will be needed on the ground once a ceasefire is in place; and engage with third actors like China and India against 🇷🇺 threats to use nuclear weapons.
>
>Peace for 🇺🇦 is a long way off. 🇷🇺 is waging a war of aggression and has so far sabotaged a negotiated solution. An end of the war now would likely mean an end of independent 🇺🇦. So not only 🇺🇦 but also its supporters need to stay the course.

"Do you actually have any independent sources to back these claims? There is quite a bit of context missing here. Trump purposely delayed the aid to Ukraine and never let up on it, using it as political leverage. It wasn’t until pressure forced him to send that package, and it was a nothing burger compared to what was sent under the Biden administration frankly. If you are as independent as you claim, you’ll see that not only was his reason outright bogus, claiming he wanted to be careful of Ukrainian “corruption” that only the orange dumbass could think up, but also that the aid provided was nearly EXACTLY the same sent from the Obama administration. The only reason the Obama administration had held off lethal aid was in the hopes the situation would not escalate. By the time Trump let the Javelin rocket systems into Ukraine (only 37 of them), Russian artillery had already backed off the main areas of fighting. Now before you go off into a rant about media bias, this article here cites and backs up everything, and yes it’s independent. https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2019/09/25/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-us-aid-package-to-ukraine-that-trump-delayed/"

"**Warning Russian air force could become 'major factor' in Ukraine war** 

*Russian fighters have remained highly effective and lethal against Ukrainian aircraft near the frontlines throughout the war.*

A new report has warned that Ukraine is in danger of running out of the weapons it needs to combat Russian air attacks.

In a new report, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), the London-based defence and security think tank, has warned Western nations to maintain and step up their supply of air defences to Ukraine and ""avoid complacency"".

So far, both Russia and Ukraine have been unable to gain full control of Ukraine's skies during the war – this is in most part due to the pilots' risk of getting shot down by each other's air defence systems.

The Russian air force outweighs Ukraine's significantly, both in size and complexity.

RUSI's report, however, has noted that ""Russian target sets have changed during the war"", and they have had to resort to a ""long-range strike campaign"".

Their report has highlighted how the most recent campaign against Ukrainian power and water infrastructure blends Iranian Shahed-136 loitering munition strikes with larger missiles.

It also noted Russia's inability to destroy Ukraine's mobile surface-to-air missile systems as the reason why Russia remains unable to effectively employ the potentially heavy and efficient aerial firepower of its fixed-wing bomber and multirole fighter fleets.

**""The West must avoid complacency""**

According to the RUSI report,"" the West must avoid complacency about the need to urgently bolster Ukrainian air-defence capacity"".

The report states that ""it is purely thanks to its failure to destroy Ukraine's mobile SAM systems that Russia remains unable to effectively employ the potentially heavy and efficient aerial firepower of its fixed-wing bomber and multi-role fighter fleets to bombard Ukrainian strategic targets and frontline positions from medium altitude, as it did in Syria.""

Airpower and military technology expert, Justin Bronk, who is also the report's lead author, told Forces News that ""Russian air power is largely neutralised in a strike perspective... it's a threat in being, rather than a major threat day to day.""

""They are limited to very low-altitude attacks essentially, beyond the frontlines which are then at great risk from MANPADS (man-portable air defence system)... and even anti-aircraft fire.""

Mr Bronk however did highlight the success of the Russian Fighter Force.

""It's been very effective at the moment. So what they've done is divided Ukraine, the contact areas in Ukraine into eight different sectors and they have a pair of fighters on combat air patrol in each one during daylight hours.

""The Russian air force is flying about 140 to 160 sorties a day. They are being highly, highly effective at inflicting losses on Ukrainian ground attack sorties.""

Due to the ""powerful radars"" the Russian aircraft maintain along with the long-range missiles, ""they are able to threaten and regularly shoot down Ukrainian ground attack sorties from far, far outside the range of any Ukrainian retaliation"".

Mr Bronk told Forces News that ""if the Ukrainians aren't supplied with additional ammuniation for their medium range SAMs and ultimately replacement systems to start phasing in Western resuppliable equivalents, things like NASAMS, then ultimately the VKS, the Russian air force, could start to become a major factor on the battlefield in a way that it just hasn't up to this point in the war"". 

He added: ""If those SAMs are no longer able to fire, those sorties will come back in again and we could see a lot more heavy firepower from the air on Ukrainian army positions but also on cities, on towns, on infrastructure near the frontlines.""

In the short term, ""Ukraine urgently requires more MANPADS and anti-aircraft guns to sustainably destroy Shahed-136s"", the RUSI report states.

It also calls for the Ukrainian air force to be supplied with Western fighter jets, but explains how any type supplied will have to be suitable for Ukrainian dispersed basing tactics and low-level combat sorties against capable Russian fighters."

Long story short, if we do nothing then Russia _will_ chip away at Ukraine's defences until they're so stretched that they can start using their air force more effectively again"

Bad faith tactic in all its glory.
I think the problem is the headline. The Russian Air Force is less effective over time as they lose planes and use up precision missiles and they are now deploying moth-balled planes that are crashing on their own. I think a better headline could be “Russian Air Force still a major factor despite significant losses and reduced combat effectiveness”.
Ridiculous

"The full research is well worth the time to read, I think it's an extremely interesting snippet of the lessons that the air war in Ukraine is teaching the world's militaries. One part that I think is particularly noteworthy for the West is that it's the mobile TELAR SAMs like Buk and TOR, where the missiles and radar are a self contained unit that can operate independently, which have proven to be the most effective. This despite the fact that the S-3/400 SAMs are technologically superior missiles and radar. I think that's problematic for the West, because to my knowledge our medium range SAM development is focused exclusively on the battery style ones and not TELARS, certainly Patriot, Iris-T, SAMP/T and Sky Sabre are all of that ilk"
Uh huh. Russian troll.
"100% Renewable energy is impossible. It cannot and will never be sufficient to meet the energy needs of the West, especially Europe, and Russia has known this all along. Russia is behind the whole ""anything but nuclear"" environmental movements worldwide. Germany is a perfect example of this. The Green Party there has completely infiltrated the media and political arena. It is no coincidence that Germany is on the forefront of chasing the wet-dream of %100 renewable minus nuclear power, while at the same time being the worst hit by Putin's weaponization of energy, i.e. natural gas. The sooner all countries in Europe start focusing heavily in nuclear energy technology, the sooner we will see a more, stable, peaceful and prosperous Europe, and with that the world."

"I mean what discussion would you like to have?

Violence as a form of control is very much a systemic issue within the Russian military and prison system and has been so for centuries. It even has a term ""dedovshchina"". sexual violence is also common.

The only surprising thing I see is how usually the violence is committed from the top down. What is happening between these Chechens and ethnic Russians appears to be lateral violence, between two groups who should be equals. Which means the authorities in charge are even weaker than expected, which is only a good thing if you are pro Ukraine.

why negotiate when you have no intention of making a deal. russia knows what it needs to do to get a deal.
"Ah, good point. 

Interestingly, they annexed these regions in accordance with the Ukrainian administrative borders where their control doesn't go to the border (like Zhaporizia), but beyond those borders where their control goes beyond the border (like Kherson). Even Russia doesn't know where its current border is supposed to be."
The only positive of a cease fire or peace right now is to move troops into Ukraine and train them train them train them. Help them dig deep defenses and sell them everything they ask for in quantities they ask for and train them on them on scale. Russia will never stop exterminating Ukraine. This is the 3rd full blown attempt in 100 years .

He ultimately gets transferred to another school cause he’s such a pussy. Russia is that pussy ass punk in the form of a country"
It seems that Putin’s Cook is placing loyal criminal paramilitary forces in the big cities … interesting to see how this plays out. A Coup under preparation?
"Yes, that part is true. The part about our attack however is unclear, russian sources tend to report phantom moves by UAF all the time"
There's no evidence that these two men were involved in the drone program.
"Oh no. No no no. Worse. Stalin had bulldozers outside Leningrad just push dirt over roughly 2 million corpses from both sides. You can barely even call that a mass grave, it's more of a body dump. Those are the bodies these guys are reburying."

"It was not necessarily damning for the Trump campaign, but it left no doubt about the fact that the interference happened. This was also confirmed by British, French, German... intelligence services in their respective elections. Do you think they are all wrong in that assessment?

Regarding Facebook, what I had in mind was a report from 2020 concerning 65000 accounts or so. And yes, it's a drop in terms of number of accounts, but this ""drop"" accounts for a significant amount of content creation and sharing -- amplified by Facebook's natural echo chambers.

Of course that shouldn't divert the debate from policy and making a good campaign, but it should also not be understated how dangerous that state of affairs is. And when it comes to the point that Russians can brag at home about their bots and trolls conspiring to bring a more favorable Congress in January, we should not pretend not to hear.

Regarding the narrative, are you sure that's really what happened? From what I could see from over here, everybody acknowledged post-facto that Clinton was a poor candidate and single-handedly lost the campaign. It's not a coincidence that she basically disappeared from the stage after 2016 (unlike, say, Obama who's still very welcome to campaign in support of select candidates)."

">They're only useless because Ukraine's effectively using SAMs to suppress them, 

Bullshit,  the RUAF bombed snake island,  a large and immovable object,  still only managed to hit the island with 1 bomb out of 4.     They had to crowd source 2 forklifts to help with loading munitions onto planes"
Neutrality is pretty pointless if you stop being neutral when bad stuff starts happening
Ask them to look for the money the Nazi’s took from my relatives during WWII while they are there.
"This announcement comes purely as a response to Zelensky's conditions that he announced yesterday. They want to make it seem like Ukraine are unreasonable while Russia just wants to talk.

Fuck them."
"That's exactly it. The answer to all of these are really ""so what?"". And I don't mean that to mean I take kidnapping of children to be acceptable, more to mean, what is going to happen? If breaking international law results in a ""tut tut"" but no action, then the law is essentially useless.

Now I know there has been a bunch of action already taken, but it seems like we're now in a situation where Russia has already passed the point of no return, so there is no incentive for them to NOT continue to break more and more laws, since there is effectively no punishment that can be handed out.,"
Shut up crybaby! Imagine how the goats feel!!!
"Karydovtsy get really triggered towards sex when they hear ruzzians say ""suka BLEAT"""

Troops feels secondary. Insetad provide UA with the long range ballistic capabilities they've been asking for so they don't have to expose UAF soldiers to risk while eliminating the invaders.

What are they going to use for their production certificate. 

I’d love to see them do it, but you’re talking about a 15 billion dollar endeavor."

Informative clip. 3:30 is when he starts talking about the title specifically.
">I.e. specific small but important targets...

You can add ammo dumps, bridges, troop concentrations, training facilities, close-in protection for large SAM sites, etc. Plus, the ammo for it is not an issue unless Ukraine wants the depleted uranium cored style. Not as mobile as Gepard but probably more available. This would free up Gepards to stay with front-line units."

&#x200B;

Look it up."
"Where do you guys get this crap from? Kadyrov retarded? Prigozhin having better connections than Kadyrov?

Firstly, Kadyrov is an incredibly astute political operator, who rebuilt his father's collapsing political base and deftly out-maneuvered and exiled the Kremlin, FSB, and MoD backed power-brokers in Chechhya, like the pre-war opposition leaders (e.g Alkhanov) and the main Chechen paramilitary leaders like the Yamadaev clan, and he did this in his late 20s. .

Secondly, the notion that Prigozhin is better connected than him is preposterous. Prighozin is a sockpuppet for the President's office with zero independence, he's a businessman with only one foot in the security door. Kadyrov, on the other hand, is incredibly well-connected in the FSB, RosGvardiya, and even the MoD, with a huge wealth of personal and business dealings with the top dogs in these structures, and moreover he deals with the Kremlin from a position of strength, because of how absolute his hold in Chechnya is. Meanwhile, Prigozhin just reads from scripts that Putin's men write."

1. Probably against Geneva Convention rules.
2. The ruzzians didn't care about those guys to begin with. They would have no problem killing their own."

He has a gun right? Just shoot the kadyrovites and call it a day.
"1) This won't have any impact on the ammo request.
2) They raided german UBS branches. Not swiss ones.
3) They're not suspecting criminal activities by the bank employees.
4) Germany bought the company to produce the ammo. They would have produced them by now if they heeded the advice of the CEO. They haven't requested the production even until know."

Went from fucking goats to fucking sheep.
And the POWs have a real value. In exchange for POWs from the other side.
But they have advanced weaponry from 1950
Back to USSR...
Well I definitely regret clicking that
Thanks for the info and the laugh.
I 100% support our efforts but After 89 billion ish in support  they should have learned to fight their own war! Once a again at some point we will be paying for this for the near future. Our citizens could use a break! We eclipse every other country in aid. Time to circle our wagons.
"putin isn't being backed into a corner. he's putting himself in a corner he created himself. no ones concearned about it. no one takes it seriously. 

&#x200B;

except you apperently. lmao. cowering in fear. 

i've told you already. if putin is determined to use nuclear weapons to impose his will on the world, then nuclear war is already inevitable. no matter what happens in ukraine. you're gonna argue that nuclear war should be avoided at all cost, you'll buy yourself a few extra years whilst throwing 44 million people under the bus right away. you consider that a humanitarian or sane argument. it says enough. 

&#x200B;

in any case, if you're willing to doom 44 million to buy yourself a few more years to live your life the way you've grown accustomed to before putin sets his sights on the next nation with the same rhetoric, you're not making a rational argument. 

&#x200B;

but that was clear already from the line ""Also are you personally on the front lines? Because it’s easy to call other people cowards from the comfort of your couch when other people’s lives are on the line.""

&#x200B;

"I don't know how these Russian families can sleep at night knowing that they're holding a child prisoner. I don't know how they can sleep knowing that many of these children watched their parents be murdered right in front if them and are old enough to remember this forever. I don't know how they can sleep at night knowing that in 5 or 10 years when these children are teenagers some of them will have years worth of hatred simmering inside of them and one day decide that it's time to take revenge on the people who murdered their families and kidnapped them. Especially since now they'll be able to access the internet and be reminded of what was done to them, and probably find groups of others who suffered the same fate. 

I don't know what these Russians are expecting."
