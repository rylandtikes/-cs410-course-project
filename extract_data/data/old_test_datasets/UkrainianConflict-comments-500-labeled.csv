Negotiations took place in two formats: the Normandie 4 (🇺🇦🇷🇺🇩🇪🇫🇷) and the Trilateral Contact Group (🇺🇦🇷🇺, OSCE, de-facto authorities of the occupied territories regularly present). Things went downhill from 2018 at the latest. In 2021 tensions escalated, with 🇷🇺 troops deployments along the 🇺🇦 border and Moscow’s ultimatum on „security guarantees“ in December 2021. This was an attempt to switch levels and force the US and NATO (after their chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan) into an agreement about 🇺🇦 and a European security order à la russe.

After all, they had been based on the principled recognition of 🇺🇦’s territorial integrity by all sides (from a 🇷🇺 perspective: without Crimea). In the early days of the invasion 🇷🇺 formulated maximal demands tantamount to total capitulation and the dissolution of the 🇺🇦 state.

What remains to be done is to support 🇺🇦in order to shift this balance and bring about a „ripe moment“ for real cease-fire talks. The goal of which must be for 🇺🇦to preserve its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. Apart from that, Western states can flank the ongoing efforts of 🇹🇷and the UN, particularly also with regard to the grain deal; get ready to give 🇺🇦 security guarantees and prepare an international peacekeeping mission, which will be needed on the ground once a ceasefire is in place; and engage with third actors like China and India against 🇷🇺 threats to use nuclear weapons.
