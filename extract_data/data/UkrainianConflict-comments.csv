Now? Modern nuclear warheads that are equipped on fighter jets pack **300 KT** or **x18** the power of those strategic weapons used back in WW2 and there are **tens of thousands of them.**


Now let's talk about the continent destoryers. The B83 Nuclear Bomb (ICBM) is a variable yield strategic weapon with an output of **1,200 KT** or **x75** the power of the weapons used to end WW2. 


**there are thousands of them in the active arsenal of the US.**

Whatever the response, It'll be well measured and considered.  Preferably they want Russia to take responsibility and pay reparations. If not they will ultimately want to plan out something that shows they respond to the exact threat presented against NATO but doesn't necessarily trigger Russia to escalate with a response to the response.

No one said it wasn't clear who fired it, only that it likely wasn't fired from Russian territory... which makes sense, since Belarus is MUCH closer to the impact site than Russia is. There isn't any reason *right now* to think it's an S-300, but figuring out the type of missile should be very easy for the Polish government... which seems to think Russia is responsible."

You would need to be 100% prepared to shoot down Russian aircraft without flinching. You have to hope Russia won’t intentionally violate it to either call your bluff and significantly damage your credibility for future NFZs, or force you to shoot down one of their aircraft so that they can escalate in other ways and use it for additional propaganda. 

Also, Russia (embarrassingly) does not have total air control. Ukraine is operating aircraft successfully. This makes the net impact of the NFZ less significant than situations where one side has established total air superiority against an opponent with insufficient anti-aircraft systems, allowing them to bomb with impunity. I am pretty that was how Russia planned for it to go, in which case a NFZ would be helpful, but still a dicey proclamation due to the reasons I mentioned above.

Giving Ukraine more advanced weapons with greater range and power that were previously withheld would be a more measured response."

You would need to be 100% prepared to shoot down Russian aircraft without flinching. You have to hope Russia won’t intentionally violate it to either call your bluff and significantly damage your credibility for future NFZs, or force you to shoot down one of their aircraft so that they can escalate in other ways and use it for additional propaganda.

And what other reaction you would expect?

If it's declared as russian missile (intentional, or not - does matter), only NFZ - at least in some buffer area around NATO - Ukraine border is a sensible option. This village is right at the border, so it's not like we can go with ""oh we can wait until it crosses into NATO territory and then we can shoot it down"".

Easy as that - russian shit goes into buffer zone, it gets shot down because russian proven themselves as incapable of respecting borders of engagement. Their only salvation would be if NATO declares that it wasn't russian, but i.e. Ukrainian S-300 going stray."

1668580620.0,iwk9ui6,t5_30hhs,0,1,Acrobatic-Till5092,0,"""Vranyo"" doesnt really translate well.  I learned it from a Perun video and then looked up myself, perhaps the most concise translation would be: ""a culture of knowing lies.""

Basically it means that everyone is telling lies, and that everyone knows everyone is telling lies, but that everyone is going to act as if no one is telling lies.

It is honestly a little difficult to comprehend  because of the scale involved.  I was reading an Estonian article that discussed how the West views Russia, and they brought up the fact that we tend to think Russian culture is - at its core - like our own.  That Russian culture is like American or European culture, when really it is as different as China's.

Some of the people interviewed in the article posited that after so many centuries under brutal totalitarian regimes, that things as simple as ""lies are bad"" isnt something neccesarily obvious to them.  Russians have to lie constantly, about their opinions, about current events, about everything, because if they day the wrong thing they will be punished for it.

A good example is how Russian Youtubers who left before the war in Ukraine won't call it a war.  When one of them responded to the questions of why he wouldnt, his response was: ""If I called that a war, I would be breaking the law, and I really want to see my family again.""

Truth is dangerous in Russia, and has been for hundreds of years.  As a result, so long as that is true, Russia is inherently untrustworthy.

The cure would be to remove the authoritarianism and allow enough freedom for people to not fear the truth, but unfortunately other aspects of Russias history have also introduced mistrust and disgust for democracy and elections.  Russia still had *serfs* not all that long ago, and their first brush with elections happened a little before World War One and was crushed by the Czar.  Their second attempt was during World War One and can only be described as a disaster, which led to the rise of the Bolsheviks.

After that was the Communist government of the USSR until the 90's, where the Russian Federation's President gets into - how shall I put this - a bit of a tussle with the legislative branch that involved massive riots and tanks firing on the legislature itself.

And after that is Putin.

What is notable is that every time they have attempted democracy it has been during a time of chaos and poverty.  And Putin has spent years working to delegitimize the concept of democracy further.

So many Russians will actively fight against a system that would remove the fear at the heart of ""vranyo"" from their society.

Russian culture is a reminder that cultural relativism is a terrible idea - or at least the type of cultural relativism that suggests that we shouldn't judge other cultures."

The name refers to the fact that the missile itself is only a passive detector of a radar signal—provided by an external (""offboard"") source—as it reflects off the target (in contrast to active radar homing, which uses an active radar transceiver). Semi-active missile systems use bistatic continuous-wave radar. The NATO brevity code for a semi-active radar homing missile launch is Fox One.

Iron Dome was designed to defend against an enemy who is spamming hundreds of low-tech unguided ballistic rockets. One of its best features is targeting software that automatically decides which rockets to intercept and which to leave alone by projecting the impact location and only wasting an interceptor on a rocket that is actually going to fall on a populated area. But that projection is based on the assumption that the incoming rocket is going to follow a ballistic trajectory. In addition, ballistic rockets fly up in a high arcing trajectory, which enables Iron Dome to intercept them at relatively high altitude.

None of these conditions apply to the threat Ukraine is facing. Cruise missiles and kamikaze drones do not follow a ballistic trajectory, they fly in at low altitude and are capable of independent maneuverability. Ukraine definitely needs more air defenses, but Iron Dome is the wrong tool to counter the threat they face."

Russian assets throughout the west agree.

 The rarely come straight out and say ""no money to Ukraine"".  Instead, they question whether money is disappearing. It isn't. -  Or whether it's being spent properly.  It is.  Both the US and EU have verification and validation programs in place.

> It’s also important to solve our many, many festering domestic problems. 

At least in the US, cutting Ukraine aid wouldn't move a dollar towards festering domestic problems.  This because Ukraine is a rare issue of bipartisan comity.   Festering domestic issues don't have the votes to pass the House and Senate.  Ukraine does.

If the goal is to fix festering domestic issues, make sure the Democrats win the House, Senate, and Presidency in 2024.  And the Senate by enough to kill the filibuster.  That's the only way those issues will see any funding.

>  The scale is tilted too far right now.

The west is receiving benefits that would be a bargain at 10 times the price.

Over the past 70 years, the west has spent *trillions*, yes, trillions, keeping the Russian bear at bay.  
 Ukraine is doing all the hard work, the west is merely providing the funding and weapons.  And the result will be a largely de-weaponized and defeated Russia.

This war should bring an end to Putin, and if we're lucky, an end to Russian dictatorship. Meaning one less power pointing nuclear missiles at the west, and a weakening of dictatorships the world over.

So yes,  funding Ukraine's defense is a bargain at ten times the price."

Honestly, I can't understand what the Russians are even trying to do.  Attacks on civilians have never worked to stop a military conflict - with one exception.  The bombings on London didn't stop them from fighting in WW2, and neither did the bombing in Berlin stop the Germans.  The American firebombing of Japan?  Nope, not nearly enough.  

We had to nuke them.  Twice.

And, just in general, dumb bombing campaigns or artillery fire that isn't guided is terribly ineffective.  The British bombardment of German lines in the Battle of the Somme in WWI?  Seven days of shelling and over a million artillery rounds fired only for the British to charge and be slaughtered.  Operation Rolling Thunder in Vietnam?  Killed hundreds of thousands of people, most of which were civilian, and accomplished basically nothing in the end.

I am not even arguing ethics or morals here - I am pointing out that it just doesn't work.  If you can't accurately and consistently hit military targets you are just wasting your ammunition and time for little - if any - gain.  The one time it did work the weapons in question became so reviled worldwide that their very existence is nearly taboo, to say nothing of their actual use.

Look, collateral civilian deaths during strikes on valid military installations is something - well, ""accept"" isn't the right word - grudgingly acknowledge as something that is inevitable.  There is no military on earth that can fight a war without civilian casualties or committing some war crimes.  The between Russia and most other countries is that Russia isn't making mistakes and having a few men out of hundreds of thousands be terrible people - civilian death and war crimes are *their entire plan.*

Worse still, it wouldn't even be hard to have shot those missiles at the transportation infrastructure in western Ukraine.  A few shots at Ukraine's rail lines would do so much to help their front lines that it is genuinely perplexing that they haven't done it.  It is as incompetent as it is evil."

The initial accusation came quickly and was very likely made (prematurely) before Kiyv had the information. They assumed, I don't think they lied. We are talking two hours or less, then night.

In the morning the clarifications are now being made.

Not sure who actually knew first. I think the US probably is tracking the Ukrainian airspace better than Ukrainians or Poles. So the Pentagon probably knew before Kiyv did. The Poles probably could have made the call late in the evening too, after surveying the wreckage. Though that's a bit technical, so it's again possible the information didn't quite make it to the politicians in time."

Particularly with pointing out that while Biden said preliminary information showed it wasn’t fired from Russia, that doesn’t rule out the Russians firing it from somewhere else, be it a Russian jet flying over Ukraine or Belarus.

A couple of observations for what they are worth.  

russia doesn't get to wash its hands of liability for this situation because the ordnance wasn't theirs.  The effort at Ukrainian self defence wouldn't have been required or deadly without russia conducting itself as a terrorist state.  It does however  mean that the gathering of ambassadors due soon at Poland's behest is unlikely to be considering any Article 5 response.

The speed and effort russia adopted to cry innocence was evidence they well realise inviting such a response is suicidal and to be avoided at all costs.  Moreover, the enthusiasm shown by  many (who took this to be targeted russian aggression against a Nato member) to unleash  previously restrained dogs of war must have been salutary to them.  The notion that a force all but on their border is governed by people just looking for the opportunity to fuck them sideways must give pause for thought.

There are increasingly few good options for russia's military in this war but inviting a legally mandated curb stomping can't be the best.  Knowing your only response at that stage is to invite the incineration of your people and nation in a nuclear exchange rather emphasises the nature of their problem.  russia has invaded Ukraine but is now deep in darkest Zugzwang."

If it was a Ukrainian missile following a Russian missile or drone, that doesn’t mean Russia is good, doesn’t mean they didn’t commit tens of thousands of war crimes, doesn’t mean they don’t deserve to be pushed out of Ukraine’s borders and tried in court for their crimes.

This is not an anti-Ukraine position. It’s just a pro-truth position.

And we even had the ministers of foreign affairs [claiming this was a conspiracy theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/ywboeb/the_russian_conspiracy_theory_about_the_fall_of/) earlier today:

>	“Russia is currently promoting a conspiracy theory that a Ukrainian air defense missile allegedly fell on the Poles. This is not true. No one should buy Russian propaganda or amplify its message. This lesson should have been learned long ago after the downing of MH17,”

Ukraine should win. Russia is acting like a terrorist state, kidnapping children, committing genocide, and every war crime in the book. But that doesn’t mean we should become blind. We should still wait for evidence, and be honest and careful in forming our own positions about things."

>At the end of September, about seven weeks before the start of the G20 summit in Bali, Konstantin* sees Russia already on the home stretch and writes a message. As a member of the delegation participating in the G20 preliminary negotiations on behalf of Russia, he feels that ""something is really happening."" He said his colleague and he were ""constantly being courted by Westerners.""
>
>Again and again, Konstantin said, representatives of Western countries stressed the importance of agreeing on a final declaration. At the end of his message he puts four closing brackets - common among Russian speakers instead of laughing emojis. The message goes to Yuriy*, who is his superior and apparently works in the Russian Foreign Ministry.
>
>For months, there has been behind-the-scenes wrangling over a final declaration for the G20 summit in Bali, one of the most important political summits in the world. Secret Russian negotiation documents and chat flows between members of the Russian negotiating delegation, which reporters from NDR were able to view, reveal Russia's strategy and show that the negotiators long did everything they could to keep terms like ""Ukraine"" or ""war"" out of the summit's final declaration. To do so, they also wanted to use their close contacts with supposed allies such as China, India and Brazil.
>
>The content of the documents, the names mentioned and the chronological sequence are plausible, even if their concrete truth content cannot be definitively verified. Formulations from a draft of the final declaration, for example, which the negotiators exchanged among themselves, match those from a draft published later.
>
>At such summits, it is common for all participating states to struggle for weeks or even months to reach a final summit declaration. In most cases, all countries try to reach a joint declaration and still accommodate important statements of their own without upsetting the other participants.
>
>Above all, the host, which in Bali is Indonesia, is trying to make a final declaration possible. The Russian delegation is also interested in finding a compromise. Thus, Yuriy writes to his colleague: ""For us, only one sentence is important: that states remember their own positions regarding the Ukrainian cause."" In this way, there would be no one-sided apportionment of blame. ""That would be a very nice outcome. But who knows whether Westerners will go for it,"" Yuriy added.
>
>At the time of the exchange between the two men, the Russian side is betting that at least Russian responsibility for the war will not find its way into the final declaration.

>It is also possible to infer Russia's general negotiating position from the conversations viewed by NDR: Russia is prepared to address Ukraine if the West accepts its responsibility for what happened and is also prepared to talk about the sanctions imposed on Russia.
>
>Konstantin, the man in the negotiating team, comes to the assessment in the chat: How flexible the countries will be in Bali will strongly depend on the current situation that then prevails in Ukraine. The Russian Foreign Ministry left an inquiry from NDR unanswered.
>
>But shortly after Konstantin's optimistic news, skepticism is spreading among him. ""The Westerners are playing a double game,"" he writes to his superior Yuriy in a long message with eight subheadings. ""On the corridors, they continue with bridge-building, bringing into play possibilities of finding a compromise: that a formulation could be found without condemning Russia."" 
>
>But things would look different on the ""official track"" - that is, in the official part: There, the representatives of the West would continue to push their line that there is a need for formulations such as ""Russia's aggressive war"" and a reference to ""Russia's condemnation and acceptance of responsibility"" in the final declaration. Fortunately, Constantine lectures further, emerging economies ""have so far responded confidently to [Western] pressure.""
>
>From the course of the two men's chat, it is clear how much Russia relied on the countries of the so-called BRICS alliance - named after the first letters of the associated countries Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - to push through its goals in the run-up to the G20 summit.
>
>But apparently there was also frustration: In the course of the conversation, Konstantin complains with some strong language to his superior in the Russian Foreign Ministry that the other BRICS countries would not sufficiently follow the formulations proposed by Russia with regard to Ukraine. For example, the Russian negotiators had proposed the phrase ""a multiplicity of conflicts"" instead of directly mentioning the Ukraine war in the final paper.
>
>In terms of behind-the-scenes sentiment, other clues can be found in the chat history. Despite complaints about the West's ""double game,"" Konstantin notes, ""Our contacts with Westerners are normal, there are business talks and friendly conversations, almost like before."" However, he says, the Australians and Germans are an exception. ""Even with the Americans, communication turns out to be smooth, sometimes even informal."" He goes on to report that ""in front of the microphone"" the Germans and French in particular ""act sharply.""
>
>But the disillusionment seems to have solidified within just a few days: ""Westerners continue to insist that it is important that the issue [Ukraine] be reflected in all 'relevant' paragraphs,"" even when it comes to energy. The goal, he said, is ""to try to justify themselves to their own citizens for energy prices and the trade deficit."" Behind the scenes, Western representatives make no secret of this, Konstantin reports to his home country.
>
>At the end of October, he finally shares with his superior the third draft of the English-language declaration, which NDR was also able to view. ""Oh, the war is in it,"" he writes - in reference to a formulation in the second paragraph, in which, however, Russia is not accused. But his superior is still optimistic about it: ""Well, so far, for optics."" 
>
>While the summit is now underway, the wrangling over the final declaration continues. In a version of the text that became known on Tuesday, the words ""war in Ukraine"" are written. However, there is no direct attribution of blame to Russia by summit participants. Only a mention of the UN General Assembly finds its way in, addressing Russian aggression. For Konstantin, his colleague and the Russian delegation, things could probably have gone worse.

The “accident” will allow them to know if  they can contemplate tactical nuclear weapons, their only chance of winning the war. It’s unlikely this was an accident, but even if it was, it has exactly the same effect.

Make no mistake, if nato fumbles this one the risk of nuclear conflict goes way, way up.

The response must be swift, proportionate, but strategically very expensive for Russia.

It needs to hurt bad enough to be just a little scary and remove any doubt as to the unified response of nato.  The future of humanity may very well depend on it.

Sanitizing Ukrainian airspace within reach of the NATO border, for example. Destroying any launchers capable of reaching NATO cities if they go active.  That would be a proportionate response.

The minimum response required to ensure that no more missiles can go into NATO airspace, since Russia apparently can’t ensure that on their own."

Then what's your rationale for why the various religious bodies held on to this knowledge and made it accessible to scholars? If they were as ""anti-science"" as you're claiming, it would have been much easier and cheaper to simply burn the books and be done with it.

Keep in mind, this was an era where books needed to be replaced regularly due to bindings wearing out, mold or moisture damaging the works, etc., and doing so involved rewriting the entire book by hand (which, given the need for literate copyists to write out the book, edit it to correct any mistakes, bind it, and decorate it, made it extremely labour-intensive). Monks were generally the ones who performed this task, to the point where many monasteries had a purpose-built room for it called a scriptorium. 

>For example, you brought up the Islamic golden but seemed to skip over why it ended - clerics deciding math is of the devil. 

Oh, good grief, this shit again.

I didn't actually bring up the ""Islamic golden"", nor the Islamic Golden Age you were probably trying to refer to with that statement. 

I'm assuming you're referring to Abu Hamid Al-Ghazali with that reference and presumably either watched Neil deGrasse Tyson's video on the subject or read some summary of it. Hate to tell you, but if that's the case you got swindled - al Ghazali was a polymath and, ironically enough given the subject of our discussion, decried the suppression of knowledge based on religious lines (i.e. the idea that Muslims should not be studying non-Muslim academic works). He was very much not anti-math or anti-science and, in fact, spoke in defence of both subjects. Tyson really needs to learn to restrict his public elucidations to subjects he's actually an expert on - I'm sure he's brilliant at astrophysics, and he's probably forgotten more on that subject than I'll ever know, but he's quite obviously not a historian (and the general public should also be viewing these lectures with a degree of skepticism that is quite clearly absent - again noting that while Tyson is an academic, it's often not in the fields of study that he likes to talk about and his opinion should therefore be afforded no greater weight than that of any other layperson).

The end of the Islamic Golden Age had a lot more to do with Hulagu Khan and the Mongols coming along and wiping Bagdhad - at the time the seat of the Abbasid Caliphate, the centre of the Islamic world, and one of the greatest cities of the Middle Ages - off the map so thoroughly that it never recovered anywhere close to its prior glory than the (in this case incorrect) suggestion that some Imams decided they didn't like arithmetic (particularly ironic, given that Muslim scholars were at the forefront of mathematical development in this era, most notably in Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi's development of algebra, arithmetic, and trigonometry)."

The characters in general are written poorly and don't have much depth, but they aren't entirely flat. Several characters were reworked and/or merged. There's some timeline compression to fit the medium, of course; some of it works well enough, while other choices cut helpful context or else are simply puzzling. Some choices in general are puzzling (London comes to mind, but I don't want to spoil anything).

I found it entertaining enough even if it fails pretty miserably at being a worthy adaptation of the novel. It was definitely less awful than The Witcher adaptation in my opinion, although in a way it reminds me of what The Expanse might look like if created with The Witcher team and budget.

Also, they didn't randomly introduce magic into the universe like they did in Foundation, so that's a big plus.

As for the books The Peripheral was a breath of fresh air, but I did enjoy Blue Ant too (I love Milgrim in Spook Country) and the Bridge trilogy is under-appreciated imo.

Like cmon dude, Ukraine is winning right now, but they're never going to invade Russia. Instant loss of all NATO backing, possible nuclear involvement, that is an absolutely braindead take. 

People want peace because as wars drag on, people die. Putin started this, he's conscripting people to carry it out, people are dying every day and a country is being turned into ruins. There are people who will NOT die if peace is made tomorrow. There are people who will NOT die if peace is made in 2 weeks, 2 months, 2 years. Pick how many people you want to save, every day the war goes on, more people die. Ukraine makes the call on the when, and if they want to push back to their internationally recognized border (including Crimea) then sure. I supported my country backing them in their defense, as soon as they go offensive and step onto sovereign ground of Russia, I'm out. Sorry but I do not support invading a nuclear state, it will only further push us towards a global conflict many orders of magnitude more severe than what we have now.

I want people to stop dying, be able to return to their homes, and live the rest of their lives in peace. Whatever gets us to that point I support, if Russia is losing and wants to talk now, get them to the table. Start the negotiations.

The Ukrainian army’s 92nd Mechanized Brigade is killing Russian draftees as fast as the Kremlin can shove the unhappy, unfit conscripts to the front near the Russian-occupied town of Svatove, 30 miles northwest of Severodonetsk in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region.

“We are just fucking meat, just fucking meat,” one draftee said in an intercepted phone call that popular social-media account @wartranslated helpfully interpreted for English speakers.

The call, reportedly with a member of the 362nd Motorized Rifle Regiment, paints a bleak picture for Russian draftees. The 362nd and a sister motorized regiment, the 346th, are under orders to hold the line around Svatove in order to slow, if not halt, the Ukrainian 92nd Mechanized Brigade’s march toward Severodonetsk, which Russian forces captured in July after months of hard fighting.

But the Russian regiments, partially staffed by some of the 300,000 men the Kremlin rounded up and forced into military service back in September, hopelessly are outmatched. “We have nothing!” the caller exclaimed. “How can we fight against mortars and tanks?”

The mismatch should come as no surprise. The 92nd Mechanized Brigade is a volunteer unit with well-maintained T-64 tanks and BTR fighting vehicles. Since the start of Russia’s wider war on Ukraine in February, the brigade has fought, and won, a series of battles in and around Kharkiv Oblast just north of Svatove. Now it’s got Severodonetsk in its sights.

The 362nd by contrast is as much a penal colony as it is a fighting formation. Its officers issue impossible orders and threaten the draftees with severe punishment if they retreat. After that, the officers disappear to the relative safety of the regiment’s rear area, leaving the untrained draftees to fight, without leadership, what arguably is the world’s most experienced mechanized brigade.

Posting to Svatove is a veritable death sentence for Russian conscripts. “Our battalion commander was bullshitting that we need to hold for two weeks” before replacement troops would arrive, the caller explained. “How the fuck can we hold here for two weeks?” The regiment lost 2,500 killed—half its manpower—in just the previous 12 days, the caller claimed.

Now just 100 survivors are trying to hold positions that 2,500 men failed to hold earlier this month, he said. When they complained, their officers labeled them deserters and threatened them with prison sentences. And when 300 wounded men crawled away from the line of contact, the regiment’s officers declared them deserters, too.

“Put us in prison,” some of the draftees told their officers, according to the caller. Better prison than the grave.

The kicker, for the beleaguered Russians, is that their regular forces aren’t faring much better around Svatove. Yes, the regiments of lightly armed draftees are getting massacred. But so too are units operating modern T-72B3 tanks. Ukrainian troops captured three intacted T-72B3s from a muddy field outside Svatove on or before Wednesday.

So for instance Shoigu is pretty hawkish but less so than Putin, I'd say so is Naryshkin, and Medvedev too(yes I've heard the things he's said, it's a performance which shouldn't be taken very seriously by anyone on its own merits). So we can find people in the Kremlin who are less hawkish than the current leadership, and for instance if Medvedev or Shoigu came to power we could expect to see if not an outright attempt at a face saving withdrawal than steps to be taken towards de-escalation. However, the odds that either of them would be able to get anywhere close to power are extraordinarily low. So there are less extreme people who've been able to survive and even thrive in the Kremlin, but none of them are in a position to take control

I'm not familiar with any, though I don't claim encyclopedic knowledge on the subject. Care to provide an example?

>and what kind of ""education"" was encouraged anyway?

Intellectual enlightenment was considered a path to godliness in those times, which is why it was a codified part of a monk's living. Part of why monasteries became de facto copy-houses and churches founded and maintained many of the world's libraries in the first millennium AD was due to monks copying out reference texts for use in their studies and contemplations (pre-Christian texts and works of knowledge from antiquity were considered invaluable to contextualize religious scripture). That gave them levels of literacy and skills in book production that were rare in the Middle Ages (book production being a much, much more labour-intensive task in the age before the printing press) and their scope of preservation gradually broadened.

>if scientific progress was widely propagated anywhere in the middle ages,it definitely wasnt in the sphere of influence of the book burning,script hoarding catholic church 

Kind of odd that your emoji-laden screed is zeroing in on the catholic church when I was referencing a much wider body of institutions than just them, but you do you.

>you do not propagate science by picking and choosing what results you like and tucking everything else away

Which the church generally didn't do. Think about what you're saying - in that era, due to the fact that there was no such thing as ""atmospheric controls"" or proper seals on houses, moisture damage, mold, and other environmental conditions quickly degraded books and other texts, necessitating that they had to be constantly re-copied. You're saying that the church, rather than either destroying these works or just letting nature run its course, decided instead to seal them away yet bizarrely still go through the rather arduous process of maintaining them? That makes zero sense.

Also, if we're being technical, yes, you do propagate science that way. For one, results that are considered erroneous or poorly founded get discarded all the time - that's a normal part of the scientific method. For two, even discounting that, science is still being propagated the way you've phrased it - just not in its entirety.

>to this day paywalls and elitist for profit capture hinder true scientific progress,and that was many times worse back then

I don't disagree, but I also don't think it furthers your point. Education was the domain of the rich and privileged for most of human history, largely because for most of human history we didn't have the tools needed to conduct mass education (hard to educate an entire populace when 90+% of them are needed for food production and distribution, and where a single copy of a book takes months if not years of multiple peoples' work to produce). 

Some historical perspective is in order to contextualize this viewpoint."

Because Russia and the U.S. both have a recession does not mean the two recessions are the same.

Of course we can't rule out that NATO is actually telling the truth, but there are several valid arguments to doubt this statement from the US and Poland.

Probably the only reason why the Dutch government gave in and we did end up having a rare period of mourning was to show the world we did care about the fact so many (Dutch) people were just murdered in cold blood by Russia. 

And even after that I feel like we didn't do enough to try and get justice for the victims.

&#x200B;

there's an agressor and a defender in this story. and that changes the perception of the impact completely. ukraine has no choice but to defend itself, and if during it's defense a missile malfunctions, there's a reduced blame. because that missile wouldn't have been fired if there was no threat to ukraine. russia is in the offender corner, though.

&#x200B;

russia fires missiles dileberatly to harm ukraine. which then forces ukraine to defend itself quite literally by all means possible. if the missile was fired by russia, then russia is the one that initiated the action, russia is the one that opted for a flight path that directed the missile over poland. russia is the one to blame for intruding on sovereign soil."

Her hatred of lgbtq people is extremely well documented, here's her Wikipedia entry on the subject:    

>Meloni has opposed the 1993 Mancino law [it], a hate speech law. She is opposed to the DDL Zan, an anti-homophobia law that would expand the Mancino law to cover LGBT discrimination, declaring in 2020 that ""there is no homophobia"" in Italy. She is also opposed to surrogacy, which is pejoratively known in Italian as utero in affitto, and she has pushed in Parliament for a law to make it a ""universal crime"". Meloni is supportive of the anti-gender movement, based on Catholic theology in the 1990s that condemns social positions not approved by the Catholic Church, including gender studies, and she is sceptical of what she calls ""gender ideology"";she says it is being taught in schools and that it attacks female identity and motherhood. She is supportive of changing the Constitution of Italy in order to make it illegal for same-sex couples to adopt children.

The Soviets expected the battlefield to be alternately nuclear contaminated or not, and their IFVs allowed fighting whether enclosed or dismounted. The Germans focused on anti-air accompaniment for tanks, as the tank's biggest enemy is aircraft. Only if the battlefield is uncontaminated would you be worried about infantry rushing your tanks, at which point German IFVs would dismount as well. The Americans took care of enemy aircraft with aircraft of their own, meaning APCs would be sufficient to accompany tanks, disembarking only if enemy troops tried to rush. For that reason the U.S. was the last to field a dedicated IFV."

As always there is more than one viewpoint. Russia deserves the condemnation for invading, but let's not pretend the US is innocent in all this. They gave verbal assurances which while not a formal treaty, still means something and it helped bring about a mostly peaceful end to the cold war. 

Instead of helping integrate post communist Russia, they hung them out to dry and expanded NATO eastwards at every opportunity. Using this ""strictly defensive alliance"" to take offensive actions in the Balkan war. And then we wonder why Russia is on constantly on edge.

What it shows to me is that there is evidence that the missiles were there in Belarus, there was recent transport and movement of those missiles to an airfield in range, and satellite imagery confirmed Belarus launchers able to launch them. Ok so, there is that.

But I tend to combine this with other evidence that Ukraine hadn't modified their S-300's for ground to ground, only Russia had. And further, that all Ukrainian S-300's were expressly programmed to blow up in mid air if they missed their target. 

Together that is still not conclusive, but it does cast at least some doubt that the S-300's in Poland were Ukrainian. And that's as far as I can go. Investigations are needed before this is written off as a Ukrainian mistake. And Zelensky is being pretty adamant that they are NOT Ukrainian. That may be why- cause his would have blown up in mid air instead of hitting the ground and exploding."

&#x200B;

i'm not gonna state you're either right or wrong. this event might be an absolute tragedy in the case a ukrainian air defense missile malfunctioned, or an action with hostile intent if russia knowingly fired a missile as the agressor which they knew might malfunction.

&#x200B;

i will leave you with this.

&#x200B;

52.018561, 23.794991

&#x200B;

this is a large military base in Brest, Belarus. russians have been using bases across belarus for their invasion. first for their invasion towards kyiv and chernihiv. when that failed, they used airfields to launch jets from. they have launched shahed drones and cruise missiles from belarus throughout this war. belarus is a russian ally, and russia has full military acces to belarus. this is simple fact. you're aware of this. 

&#x200B;

49°55'19.0""N 23°43'08.9""E

&#x200B;

this is a depot in ivano-frankove (not ivano-frankivske, that's further to the south, south east, this one is just west of lviv) if you go into streetview, you can see this depot has the emblem of the ukrainian military on it's wall. ukraine stores vehicles here. no doubt about it.

&#x200B;

if you were to draw a line, between that base in brest, belarus. and the depot in ivano frankovske. guess where that line passes over.infact, just go ahead and use the distance measuring tool in google maps to draw a line between those coordinates.

&#x200B;

now, we also know that russia uses S-300 missiles that they've modified to strike ground targets. essentially turning the S-300 missile into a ballistic missile. it's not easy to do so. not everyone that has the S-300 system has the know-how to do that. but russia has a dedicated team of 20 people that reprogram these missiles in order to strike ground targets. 

&#x200B;

[https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2022/10/24/the-remote-control-killers-behind-russias-cruise-missile-strikes-on-ukraine/](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2022/10/24/the-remote-control-killers-behind-russias-cruise-missile-strikes-on-ukraine/)

&#x200B;

that reprogramming isn't something simple apperently. and there's a small group of russian military personel that handles the input of coordinates for those missiles.

&#x200B;

take a look at the coordinates for kyiv. you'll find kyiv is on the same easting as the town in poland that was struck. take a look at the coordinates for lviv. you'll find lviv is on the same northing as the polish town was struck. simply put, if you take the northing from lviv, and the easting from kyiv. you end up with a coordinate that brings you near the town in poland that was hit. who'se to say those goons didn't get their coordinates mixed up?

&#x200B;

so next, concider how the USA and NATO might view an adequate response to either scenario. russia lobs a missile at ukraine that lands in poland. or ukraine lobs a missile in self defence that tragically malfunctions and lands in poland. what's the easier scenario to sell without resorting to conflict?

  
in the case of russia lobbing a missile with hostile intent that misses its target and lands in poland, assurances and guarantees have to be put in place to prevent that scenario from happening again. ergo, on the high end of the response spectrum there's a no fly zone option. anything over ukraine, belarus or russia that comes towards nato and is considered hostile is shot out of the sky. either by AA, jets or any other option. at the middle end of that spectrum is establishing an air defense shield on the polish border that reaches out over the border, into belarus and ukraine, and shoots down anything that's considered hostile. on the low end of that spectrum is establishing an air defense shield along the polish border that shoots down anything that actually crosses into polish territory. that's a huge fucking thing no matter what solution you provide to give those assurances and guarantees. but those assurances and guarantees must be provided in such a scenario to qualify as an adequate response. 

&#x200B;

in the scenario where ukraine fires an air defense missile in self defense that tragically malfunctions, the likely response that's seen as adequate is covering the incident with a blanket of understanding, and ensuring ukraine doesn't have to rely on shitty faulty malfunctioning russian made air defense systems in the future, so that another incident like this will be prevented that way.

&#x200B;

i'm not gonna tell you what's right or wrong, i don't have acces to all the information surrounding this event. neither do you. and i'd be surprised if nato or the USA itself actually has radar tracks that confirm beyond a shadow of a doubt where the missile originated from. and even if they do, it could still very well be a ukrainian s-300 missile that intercepted a russian cruise missile in just the right way where the s-300 exploded near enough to a russian cruise missile to knock it out of the sky but the warhead still detonated on impact. 

&#x200B;

we just don't know. and wether we'll ever know is in the hands of the parties investigating the incident and the evidence they supply. what i will tell you, is without final conclusions of the investigation, it's too early for people like you and i to draw conclusions yet.

&#x200B;

personally, i've got faith in ukraine, ukraines leadership and command structure. i'm inclinded to believe zelensky if he says his air force and zaluzhny himself reported that it was not an ukrainian missile. though, it should be noted that zelensky also stated to accept the outcome of the investigation and if it does turn out to have been an ukrainian missile, ukraine will formally appologise to poland and pay reperations for the damage done."

Back in March/April when John Kirby was still the Spox for the Pentagon, he remarked about how the Pentagon specifically setup a ""deconfliction line"" that allowed lower level staff outside of the political leadership to communicate about non-political issues or more importantly issues that require immediate attention such as this.

During this time period reporters would ask him about it and he'd indicate that the US would ring up Russia every month or so just to make sure the line was working. Literally all they needed was a ""Yup, still working"" but it was clear from the DoD Spox's responses that Russia didn't answer most of the time, though it was clearly working because it would indeed ring and when the Russians did pick up they wouldn't complain about anything wrong.

I took it to mean that the Russians see even these low level tasks as an opportunity for a political show. It's more of an opportunity to brag or even impress managers about how they were able to ignore the ""stupid Americans""."

I can give you one recent example that resulted in shitload of unnecessary deaths - Covid.  
  
Obviously covid itself has nothing to do with Russia. But did they use the soft power to damage the EU and western countries? Absolutely.   
  
They run huge campaigns to promote stupid stuff like anti-vaxing, refusal to use masks etc. All of that indirectly killed actual, real people, by influencing those stupid enough to buy into all that, who spread covid like idiots.

And this is just one recent example we can actually look at.  
 
Just think about it - people are buying bullshit about EU government trying to cripple or kill them with vaccines, or masks being restriction on their freedom! 40 years ago anyone saying stuff like that would be considered insane nutjob by everyone around them.  
  
What happens if there is something EVEN WORSE than Covid, and Russia manages to use their propaganda to sabotage EU to the degree in which it gets so out of hand, that EU simply collapses due to plague? You don't think that something like that is indirect waging of war? The intent is pretty clear to anyone who can see the situation from the side, I have no clue how EU citizens are still blind to this.

It takes a lot of additional infrastructure, material, produ tion space, component inventory, workers, etc., to spool up production. Most of all it takes time and money. Money Congress has to apportion: This takes time.

Ramping production from the 10's per month to the hundreds/thousands needed, if the funding and logistics is in place, will take anywhere from 6 months to two years!

In March people said that it would take multiple months to prepare the supplies of modern tanks/planes/..., so it's better to stick to weapons from Warsaw Pact countries. Multiple months have already passed now. Progress on MBTs? 0%. Progress on planes? 0% (Ukraine chose pilots for training, but as far as I am aware, the bill for funding the fucking training is still stuck in US buraeucracy for months now).

Thank all existing gods that other countries finally got around on settling the primordial question of air defence - after Oct. 10 suddenly everyone realized that, in fact, air defense is mostly a ""defensive"" weapon (duh), and, in fact, Ukraine's cries from March ""ok you won't close the sky, but give us anti-air and wr will close our own sky"" might've been onto something - and so the question of Ukrainian air defense can finally be settled in a few more months!...

“Wednesday, however, saw a rapid soothing of tensions.”

“Both Poland and NATO issued statements characterizing the missile strike as a ""tragic accident"" after the ensuing investigation determined the missile was likely fired by Ukraine as it defended itself against a barrage of missile fire by invading Russian forces.”

“And Russia—which quickly sought to distance itself from the accidental strike Tuesday—had an unlikely ally to thank for averting crisis: Biden.”

Also, non-european people maybe miss the history behind it:

Until the year 1200 ac russian provinces developed according to northern-western europe. For example the province Novgorod was part of the [Hanse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanseatic_League)

This is mentioned in the video, but not everybody may know what it means for western european development.

It is similar of what happened later in Venezia (Venice) ... commerce always had a big impact on the development of civil rule and law, as it was carried out not by ""state actors"" but private people.

Anyway ...

Then, with the occupation of Russia by mongolian tribes from the east, a rather archaic rule establishes. These tribes did have no need for rule of law. It lasted for 300 years.

And this is a heritage until today, with a deep vertical hierarchy in the rule of the empire/state.

It also explains the corruption, because corruption is also mean of control over provinces ... as a ""substitute"" or ""in the absence"" of the rule of law.

They don't have the infrastructure to distribute palletized goods and military equipment. They also don't have enough quality tires to run a military, and they don't have the means to produce them domestically (tires are still made from natural rubber, which is produced from trees that only grow in more tropical areas). Another area that is causing huge issues (and will continue to for decades) is their lack of a domestic semiconductor industry. One of their major domestic producers, Angstrem, went bankrupt likely due to large-scale corruption. Their largest chip producer, Mikron, is so far behind that their chips can't even be used in modern smartphones but are instead limited to applications like credit card chips and RFID tags. Russia is entirely dependent on the outside world for technology (and many raw materials), to the point that they are royally fucked if they can't reenter the global economy in the next year."

Many standard (I do not know what a standard bridge is) bridges are restricted to a maximum of a 36 ton heavy load and for these special heavy loads you also need permission to do this. Simply put, an Abrams would not be allowed to cross these bridges.

Abrams are also not allow on paved roads as they would rip up the asphalt in a serious way.

So Ukraine, if they were to get these tanks, would need bridge layers to accompanying them, that can support 70 tons (aka the M104 Wolverine).

And if there is sufficient airstrip, a C-17 can transport an Abrams.

Just let you know the Leopard I (approx. 42 tons) can only cross 500-600 of Poland's bridges. One city itself, in Poland, has over 100 bridges."

If that was true Zelensky wouldn't have stated categorically that it was Russia the moment the news broke, and his Foreign Minister wouldn't have said it was ""russian propaganda"" to even speculate that it might have been a ukrainian anti-air missile.  This happened while every nato country ***was*** actually saying that it should be investigated before jumping to conclusions.

Now that he has egg on his face, Zelensky hasn't admitted he was wrong, he's demanded access to the site, to the evidence, and to the NATO meeting about the incident.  He's not waiting for evidence he's trying to insert himself in the investigation and decisions surrounding it to influence the outcome, and having been told he needs special approval for that, he has no other choice but to sit on his hands and wait, grudgingly saying he'll apologize if the decision comes down against him.

After hearing that NATO thinks it was his missiles, what leader would not be re-questioning his people and demanding accounting for every single piece of ordinance in an attempt to discern what might have gone wrong and who lied and covered up a mistake and made him look foolish, since he claims that his people told him it was not them.  Instead he just re-stated his previous claims that it wasn't them because his people told him so."

Good engeneering, but too expensive.

Within Germany the introduction of these trains was a desaster ...  
Financially and also practically.

They have a technology that makes it possible to ""lean into curves"".

This was a modern concept of the time of first generation development (1980/1990).

This will help with high speed in curves.

Turns out:

German railway tracks are built too close to each other.

There could be collisions with other trains coming from the opposite direction.

Also collision with signal poles in close range of the track.

Mostly this feature could not be used.  
One of the many reasons it is much slower than per specification.

He was referring to the Azov regiment: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azov_Regiment
Literal SS logo until 2015.

2. He called Donetsk a Russian-backed separatist uprising.
That's not entirely wrong. I'll grant you it's an incomplete picture, but since we're going off what someone says about what someone else says, this is not good enough proof to me. When Ukraine threw out the Russian puppets, Donetsk had more people who were supporters of the previous administration than anywhere else. Some of the Donetsk fighters are, quite sadly, true believers.

I don't agree that he is ""very pro russia"" on this basis. He might be, but this isn't proof. 

To my point above, I am able to acknowledge that some groups in Ukraine had a bit of a fascism problem. That doesn't AT ALL mean I think the invasion was justified, or that we shouldn't arm Ukraine to fight off the aggressor, or any of the other things that Kremlin propagandists *wish* it meant. But I can acknowledge the underlying reality regardless. I support Ukraine wholeheartedly; having a racist uncles regiment does not mean your civilians deserve to be slaughtered."

BUT if Ukraine's missile is responsible, then they need to own up to it and take responsibility because it's the right thing to do. All this strange skulduggery and Zelensky flatly opposing both NATO and Poland's view is...I don't know, it's just odd.

Everyone knows that if Russia hadn't invaded there would be no Ukrainian missiles in the air at all, but if Ukraine made a mistake then they still need to own up to it. If there was a malfunction from poor maintenance, human error, bad programming or whatever else, that resulted in a Ukrainian missile killing Polish citizens, Ukraine should admit it, offer condolences, and pay reparations to the families. When the US, fighting against tyranny and fascism, bombed neutral Switzerland by mistake in WW2, they didn't just say ""not our fault, blame Hitler."" They paid reparations (albeit several years later). Likewise West Germany paid reparations to Ireland (also neutral in WW2) because the Luftwaffe (who conversely were fighting FOR tyranny and fascism at the time) bombed Dublin several times. It's justice for the families, it's the right thing to do morally, and it will continue to strengthen the already overwhelming evidence that Ukraine are acting in a righteous way and are the clear good guys.

If it was a Russian missile of course, then the families of the dead will probably never get any kind of justice at all."

Considering Russia is a major fossil fuel exporter that solves the ""cheap energy"" part. And the fact that they control a giant landmass with fuck tons of natural resources would solve the ""capital"" part. Whatever natural resource they can't make they could buy.

Every other issue is their own fault. Even the concept of being out competed by another country in a certain industry doesn't hold water since any country that cares about a certain industry enough will take measures to keep it afloat. Like the United states right now trying to start up a semi conductor industry at home out of fear that Taiwan will be invaded by china therefore putting their semi conductor industry into the hands of the CCP. Russia is an example of being your own worst enemy.

Large countries with vast amounts of natural resources and the ability to feed hundreds of millions don't really have an excuse for being so pathetic. Look at all the other players on the world stage that share those features. You have India, the us, china, and maybe Brazil. And except for Brazil they are all either global powers or rising regional powers. Russia is a declining regional power. And India has to deal with the fact that all of its neighbors are imploding (Pakistan, sri lanka ). Meanwhile Russia is bordered by Europe, a non hostile continent that would more than willingly establish very lucrative trade with Russia."

2. Probably. That is their standard procedure. That and fight proxy wars.

3 key here is China. What will they do in the vacuum and how does that play out in 10,20 years. Is it real close ties or it’s slow takeover of resources in the region?

4 it will in nato influenced areas. But not in countries that don’t fight traditional wars like Afghanistan it doesn’t work. This was have been a full attrition battle.  First time forna while we had a fight in a country that is winnable and the people your recovering territory really want you there. Because it’s your troops.

I don’t disagree with any of this. Where they managed to fight back to we will see. But at some point the majority of fighting will end and lines drawn.

A strong-man type willing use military force to achieve goals or at least punish misbehavior can prevent a lot of other bad actors from doing the same.  

Under Trump, there was no escalation of the Ukraine war by Russia despite media peddling how he was in Putins pocket.  Trump ordered the bombing of a Russian occupied airbase in Syria in retaliation for crossing an Obama red line, killed the main Iranian General responsible for organizing many terrorist attacks in Iraq, and is one of the few U.S. presidents to have allowed U.S. forces to directly fire on and kill hundreds of Russian mercenaries.  The russian ""little green men"" that took over Crimea without insignia certainly weren't so bold after the U.S. killed hundreds of them in Syria.  There are good reasons and precedent to believe that Trumps eagerness to appear strong prevented the escalation of the Ukrainian conflict during his presidency.

As Americans, we like to think others think like us and if we're just reasonable and play nice, so will others.  But that is not the case, and many leaders around the world would order horrific acts if they did not fear retaliation.  An irrational strong man is not always a bad thing as long as there are proper guardrails.

I obviously do not know all the details or can connect all the dots to know specifically how history would have changed, but Clinton, Bush, and Obama all helped lead to this war by isolating Russia, exiting treaties and attempting to build anti-ballistic missile defense right on the Russian border, while at the same time continuously trying to expand NATO, long after the USSR was done.  I don't know if that was pushed by old school CIA because they still perceived a threat, but from my laymen view it seemed unnecessary.   There was no way Russia would accept NATO countries with anti-ballistic missiles right up on their border where they are most effective.  Trying to eliminate the local influence of a former super power while all the people from its superpower days are still around is not necessarily a rational, adult decision either.  Ukraine could have waited a decade to join NATO after the old Soviet guard passed, and a conflict of this scale may have been avoided."

It can hang out in safe areas and is basically a truck with gantry. The missile pods are manufactured elsewhere. Simply installed, then removed and replaced when empty. The most complex part is the training of its firing system.

A tank is an utterly different beast. So much more is required of its functionality at the front lines. It's going to see a lot more wear and tear than a truck driving in safer areas that will unlikely ever even receive gunfire while on mission. Russia has yet to destroy a single HIMARS. Tanks drive over *everything* their treads and grip. They fire dozens of rounds per mission which means having to load all that ammo every time. The gun itself will be care for that. They will receive fire of all levels from gunfire, RPG, and artillery. They require a fully trained crew that takes longer than HIMARS would. The tank treads getting clogged with everything they have to drive through because you don't get tidy roads on the front line. Not to mention its engine or the massive amounts of fuel necessary for the beast.

I'm not saying it couldn't be done but it's just not as anywhere near as simple as HIMARS. Like the other comment said logistics is a huge deal and a tank is going to need a lot more love, which is why Russia's awful logistics loses them so many of theirs. 

I want Ukraine to have everything the US can give them and more.

>No, you fucking Fascist moron, Reagan fucked America over economically, and accomplished shit with Russia. Carter was probably the worst Democrat to be president in my life, but had he beat Reagan, the USSR would still have fallen from their own incompetence.

Calm those tits bud, you don't have to get mad about written history.  Since apparently facist can be thrown around at anyone, YOU'RE the facist.  I was there behind the Iron curtain, we all knew the Russians were overspending on military at least in part because of Reagan's hostile stance and military build up.  The Reagan Doctrine was an intentional strategy to cripple a weakened USSR economically, it certainly contributed to their downfall as they tried to compete with the incredibly expensive development of next generation nuclear delivery and defense.  In the end, he forged a friendship with Gorbachev that helped push glastnost and the end of the USSR.

Estonia and Latvia are NATO countries and they are on Russia's doorstep and a lot closer to St. Petersburg compared to Ukraine. And a similar distance to Moscow. If NATO wanted to they could have put Ballistic Missiles in those countries. NATO however is a defensive pact and so they didn't take that action. You are basically repeating Russian propaganda. Putin's actions were a land grab, pure and simple. Plus Ukraine is a sovereign country and they should have the right to join any alliance they choose. Saying otherwise is agreeing with the dictators of the world.

1668674392.0,iwp6tpo,t5_30hhs,0,1,vegarig,0,"> Is it likely the Western powers would not help even if Ukraine didn't ask?

More of ""their definition of strategic win and Ukrainian definition of victory aren't completely aligned"".

For Western countries, keeping Ukrainian rear going and civilian casualties minimalized isn't as much of a pressing need as for Ukraine, as horrible as it is.

USA seems more interested in maximizing damage to russia, as [Lloyd Austin said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/04/25/russia-weakened-lloyd-austin-ukraine-visit/), than ensuring Ukrainian victory ASAP:

>“We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Austin said.

Plus, there's an embargo on supplying tanks, jets and long-range weaponry, as [Macron said:](https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/news/2022/06/16/7141437/)

>French President Emmanuel Macron said that due to fears of involvement in the war with Russia, Western countries had agreed not to provide Ukraine with certain weapons.

>According to European Truth, Macron said this during a conversation with journalists in Kyiv on Thursday.

>""We are helping Ukraine defend itself, ***but we are not going to war with Russia, so it has been agreed not to supply certain weapons - including assault planes or tanks***, and President Zelensky is aware of this agreement,"" he said.

>The French president added that the West instead provided Ukraine with ammunition and ""certain types of equipment.""

>""And now they have also started to supply (self-propelled artillery) Ceasar. This will allow Ukraine to be more mobile and destroy the enemy from a distance,"" Macron said.

>In May, the media learned from sources that the White House was negotiating with Ukraine restrictions on the use of American weapons, particularly for purposes deep within Russia.

>At the same time, US President Joe Biden said that the United States did not plan to provide Ukraine with missile systems capable of hitting targets in Russia.

>These reports came amid discussions on the supply of long-range systems to Ukraine, especially rocket-propelled grenade launchers.

>However, in the end, the United States approved the transfer to Ukraine of four HIMARS MLRS, which are due to arrive by the end of June

So... as for me, future doesn't look quite so bright."

I think we saw some of that playing out in the midterms where one might have expected poor economic conditions to be taken out on Biden, no red wave eventuated and the GOP only made very minor gains... probably not enough to stop most of the aid to Ukraine. 

Sure, women's health and a few other problems generated by the stacked and corrupt SCOTUS also influenced the results, but overall it's become apparent Trumps influence is in decline.

There is a theory that the revolution started when they aired the TV series Dallas on romanian national TV and everyone saw how rich the americans were, more of a joke.

The people in the 60s and 70s, the good ol times of Ceausescu's rule first of all many didn't even have TVs, they lived in the countryside and had to get on a waiting list for a few years to be able to buy a gas stove, for example. I guarantee those people didn't give a shit. And the people who were moved to the cities also couldn't complain, since it was a big upgrade and living conditions were ok. Shit started to hit the fan in the 80s and they would start rationing electricity and food, not even because they didn't have any, they had more than we do now, just because of Ceausescu's stupid idea of paying off his debt to the western countries (which he used to build the factories), because he didn't understand economics and wanted to be INDEPENDENT even of the west for political reasons.

Anyway I am not saying it was good, just rejecting the notion that it was a ""soviet puppet state"", and Ceausescu went away because he lost soviet support. It was not, it was much more like North Korea. Is North Korea a soviet puppet state? Well the soviets don't exist anymore but North Korea keeps chugging along.

India buys it's oil from wherever it can because we want to bridge the energy gap untill Green Hydrogen becomes cheap and scalable. So if you cannot understand India's diplomatic policies that's ok. Doesn't give you the right to demonize it based on it's attempt to protect itself and its citizens."

There is a theory that the revolution started when they aired the TV series Dallas on romanian national TV and everyone saw how rich the americans were, more of a joke.

The people in the 60s and 70s, the good ol times of Ceausescu's rule first of all many didn't even have TVs, they lived in the countryside and had to get on a waiting list for a few years to be able to buy a gas stove, for example. I guarantee those people didn't give a shit. And the people who were moved to the cities also couldn't complain, since it was a big upgrade and living conditions were ok. Shit started to hit the fan in the 80s and they would start rationing electricity and food, not even because they didn't have any, they had more than we do now, just because of Ceausescu's stupid idea of paying off his debt to the western countries (which he used to build the factories), because he didn't understand economics and wanted to be INDEPENDENT even of the west for political reasons.

Anyway I am not saying it was good, just rejecting the notion that it was a ""soviet puppet state"", and Ceausescu went away because he lost soviet support. It was not, it was much more like North Korea. Is North Korea a soviet puppet state? Well the soviets don't exist anymore but North Korea keeps chugging along.

Despite being the largest democracy of the world Ukraine has repeatedly voted against India getting veto power in the UN. Why? What has India ever done to Ukraine? Absolutely nothing.
India buys it's oil from wherever it can because we want to bridge the energy gap untill Green Hydrogen becomes cheap and scalable. So if you cannot understand India's diplomatic policies that's ok. Doesn't give you the right to demonize it based on it's attempt to protect itself and its citizens."

Just to clarify the 3 mil votes are mostly old people and gipsies. Young population wants change. It is difficult to argue with our elderly since they are blinded by the state media and they think they know better. No matter how educated you are you are just a stupid kid in their eyes. As for the gipsies they vote for the party who pays more. I'm not angry with that 3 million people but I'm upset about the 1.5-2 million, who did not vote. They coud have changed the outcome. And this is partially because of the big coalition of the opposition. You could hear on the streats people stating ""I dont vote for the coalition because they have Jobbik or they have Ferenc Gyurcsány""  Also the coalition did not include far left (MKP) or far right (Mihazánk). Jobbik is not considered far right anymore since during the last cycle they got rid of their far right elements (Mihazánk was formed from it and got 6% of the votes). MSZP is not far left although they inherited some element of their political philosophy from the communist era, they are a socialdemocratic party. The other problem was that both Mihazánk ant the Two Tailed Dog party (a pirate party) campaigned actively against the coalition. So this is us now and I don't really know how we can restore our democracy on a democratic way."

Just to clarify the 3 mil votes are mostly old people and gipsies. Young population wants change. It is difficult to argue with our elderly since they are blinded by the state media and they think they know better. No matter how educated you are you are just a stupid kid in their eyes. As for the gipsies they vote for the party who pays more. I'm not angry with that 3 million people but I'm upset about the 1.5-2 million, who did not vote. They coud have changed the outcome. And this is partially because of the big coalition of the opposition. You could hear on the streats people stating ""I dont vote for the coalition because they have Jobbik or they have Ferenc Gyurcsány""  Also the coalition did not include far left (MKP) or far right (Mihazánk). Jobbik is not considered far right anymore since during the last cycle they got rid of their far right elements (Mihazánk was formed from it and got 6% of the votes). MSZP is not far left although they inherited some element of their political philosophy from the communist era, they are a socialdemocratic party. The other problem was that both Mihazánk ant the Two Tailed Dog party (a pirate party) campaigned actively against the coalition. So this is us now and I don't really know how we can restore our democracy on a democratic way."

Unfortunately, every country in Europe except Germany was shell shocked and gun shy, because of the appalling losses of men in WWI.

The nuclear situation makes everyone except Putin gun shy today, 70+ years after Hiroshima. Putin, like Hitler, is bloody-minded enough to be less deterred by thoughts of armageddon, than his contemporary politicians in other countries.

Like Hitler with a handful of tanks in 1937, Putin's nuclear threat is probably a bluff. He has had no money to maintain his missiles. If he orders an ICBM to launch, the odds are it will fail on the launch pad, or the warhead will be a dud. But if he orders all 6000 of his nukes launched, probably 20 of them will work, and that is enough to cause A Very Bad Day.

If the Ukraine War goes on for another year, the Russian state will collapse, and the West can buy the nukes from the new warlords who take over the remnants of the Russian Federation.

Lobbing some missiles every week is the only thing they can do, and those missiles are essentially terror weapons. They do not change anything on the battlefield, most of them are being shot down, and the damage they do is being repaired in a few days.

It would be a mistake to change focus from liberating territory to revenge efforts for the missile strikes. For every civilian killed by the missiles, the UAF kills hundreds of ill-equipped mobiks every day.

In WWII, Britain was being bombed constantly with hundreds of tons of explosives every night, yet the population was only more resolved to resist the Nazis. And russia doesn't have the firepower to actually level a city in Ukraine, nukes aside.

The power grid can be decentralized and hardened if that needs to be done. With the current resources and resolve of the UAF, russia can be defeated on the battlefield. The missiles are just a distraction, effective, but not war-winning."

The Reuters article specifically was written in 2018. It talks about how these groups have actively taken part in the defense, where the Ukrainian military fell short on the eastern front. 

So... I'm not convinced that this isn't a problem directly caused by Russian aggression. 

The statements made by the UA seem to track, in that Ukrainians laud them as heroes who put their lives on the line. 

Integration was likely the correct strategical move for the UA. 

But, I'm willing to admit I'm wrong if the wind blows the other direction."

About 30 of those 100 retired, most of them facing death threats from the alt-right. 

Budget bills theoretically originate in the House, according to the Constitution. McCarthy will need the votes of every House Republican to get elected Speaker. Many of them will make demands to get their votes for Speaker. 10-20 are paid Russian agents who will demand the end of Ukraine aid in exchange for their votes in the Speaker election. This is illegal, but it will not stop them.

Fortunately, illegal promises made in secret are not very binding. McCarthy will probably lie to get their votes in the Speaker election, and then ally with conservative Democrats to get budget items like aid for Ukraine through. He has lied about so many other things, this should not be a problem for him."

I'm saying they should greenlight in private between 2 parties and start slowly putting things in place just like how they did it in the past with other equipments and training.  These things need to be put in place first period before the tanks arrive.  Even now ukraine cannot provide adequate logistics for pzh 2000 and everytime it breaks down, they have to haul it other way to Lithuania (not a reflection on the ukrainians but rather how complex and difficult the task is).  

The thing uniquely about tanks is that the logistical hub has to be so close to the front line,  which introduce another point of vulnerability for war planners.  It will only be worth the risk if ukraine has a significant amount of tanks or else you just end up allocating forces to provide air cover/counter battery for a logistical train that doesn't provide enough offset in strategic value.  

Best way is to have things in place that can handle a significant amount of tanks, then receive a small patch for tryout immediately followed by a larger number. 

If preparation was to be put in place at some point, I don't see them announcing to the public til they receive the tanks."

Mobilization was done to buy Putin time to survive until: 1. Elections in US, 2. Winter.

1. Elections went okay for Democrats. Foreign policy won't change at least until spring 2025 + Trump and DeSantis will split the Republicans in 2024.

2. It's now more or less confirmed that EU can function without Ruzzian oil and/or gas. 


So basically Putin had 2 ways out Republican landslide in USA or hard winter in unprepared Europe.

Democrats survived, ruzzia is officially in a recession (during winter - you know the time when they usually filled up their budget...).

He will mobilize again make no mistake, 8k vehicles gone the only way to replace that is with more mobilization.

I'd say it's no concern for Ukraine in the near future. Although the uncomfortable truth is more questions will be raised the longer the war goes on. Especially if the EU doesn't come to agreement on larger aid packages for Ukraine.

I don't think it's going to be a large issue until 2024 due to the elections. I imagine it will be a topic in Republican presidential primaries. How much traction it will get will probably depend on how it polls among likely voters. 

Hopefully Ukraine has wrapped things up by then. If not, and assuming this becomes and issue in Congress, there is still Lend Lease waiting in the wings precisely for this, it was pushed through early on in the war and gives the President the ability to give US military equipment to Ukraine without Congressional authorization. Without funding that too would run out of steam eventually (the US isn't going to empty it's strategic reserves) but hopefully a few years into the future this war is either over or at such a low intensity that it's not an issue anymore for Ukraine to pull their own weight."

If you look at the actual data in 1941 they had more than enough rifles, other weapons were hit or miss though with AAA being a particular vulnerability.

If it was really was  standard for Soviet soldiers to be chasing the guy in front of him hoping he caught a bullet they would have lost the war.

-	You could withdraw only 20% of your allowance in cash from the ATM.
-	You could not transfer the money to another account.
-	You could only spend it at whitelisted companies.
-	 (Paypal and amazon payments were blacklisted)
-	big companies could easily get on the whitelist, small independent ones not so.

And if you were dumb enough to get recruited from the normal population and now you found out it isnt all fun and stealing washing machines, toilets and doing some rape, you better not complain about being cannon fooder. Or youll get reassigned as designated comfort boy into the gay brigade. With a nice entry into your record about where and how you served.

Massive effort, followed by entrenchment. They don't need many, maybe one more, if they can erase all the Russian gains in Zaphorizhia oblast, but that would be a BIG offensive. If that happens, Russia would be back close to where they were at the start of the war with Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.

That’s because peacetime arms procurements are meant to keep the national defence industry afloat and up to date. They are not meant to get the best deal possible in terms of bang per buck.

If we did that, we would end up dependent on foreign suppliers for everything, much like we are on China for many civilian industries.

By the way, the same is true for other strategic industries, like the space sector. Why do you think ESA prefers Ariane over SpaceX even if the latter might be lower cost per launch? Because a big part of ESA’s mission is to develop and preserve Europe’s native space capabilities, and an independent launch vehicle is a crucial part of that."

Nearly every major foreign  policy “decision” was a favor to Putin, like announcing a withdrawal from Syria on Putin’s birthday, or revealing top secret intelligence sources to Russian ambassadors, or extorting Zelensky by withholding a defense package to Ukraine, or advocating to dismantle NATO. Before he was president he borrowed money from Russia when US banks cut him off (cuz he’s a fraud) and was aided by Russian interference in our elections. Oh yeah, and he incited a violent mob to overthrow our government because he didn’t want to give up power after he lost by over 7 million votes. I don’t think he the devil, but I think he’s showed he has loopholes in his scruples and he’s not interested in what is best for his country, he is out for himself 💯. 



Biden’s son struggles with substance abuse. That is what the GOP is focused on when they talk about Biden’s ethics. Not sure how that means Joe is corrupt, but who needs logic when you’re owning the libs/s. [There is video of Lindsey Graham crying about what a good man Joe Biden is ffs](https://youtu.be/kLMYW8jFPHg)

Also, Zelensky is the reason Ukraine is still standing under its own volition. He was offered safe evacuation by foreign powers and famously responded “I don’t need a ride I need ammo”.  This was nearly 9 months ago and Ukraine is still standing (and winning). Russian bombing of infrastructure and civilian population centers, and blockade on Ukrainian grain exports, and sham annexation referendums have weakened Ukraine’s economy, not Zelensky’s policies.

In 1958, the film was voted number 1 on the prestigious Brussels 12 list at the 1958 World Expo. Battleship Potemkin is considered one of the greatest films of all time.

No one did, not even those who previously served, or currently *run* that military. The only ones who knew were the ones who would be *extremely* punished should they speak out about it. Not to mention lying about things like military standards to pass inspection is so culturally embedded, they actually have two different words for lying.

vranyo is a lie that is told for a specific purpose, but everyone (at least everyone in-the-know) knows it's false. Like if you're my commander, and you know I'm a mess, but still report I'm in top shape. We both know you're lying, but we also both know we get punished if you didn't lie.

At least, that's my understanding. Russia's going to need a lot of help/support after all of this is over if we want to move away from them getting caught up in this stuff. The entire system is basically set up to be taken advantage of, and it will take generations of constant challenge and change to move away from that, otherwise we'll just get a new Putin in 40 or so years."

Traces of explosives have been found at the site of the damaged Nord Stream pipelines, a Swedish prosecutor has said.  
  
Last month, a preliminary investigation of damage on the two Nord Stream gas pipelines in the Danish part of the Baltic Sea showed the leaks were caused by ""powerful explosions"".  
  
The findings were similar to those of Swedish prosecutors, who said two other holes in the pipelines also seemed to have been caused by deliberate subsea blasts and the case was investigated as an act of gross sabotage.  
  
Confirming that sabotage had taken place, the Swedish Prosecution Authority said in a statement: ""Analysis that has now been carried out shows traces of explosives on several of the objects that were recovered.""  
  
They added: ""The investigation is highly complex and comprehensive. The ongoing probe will determine whether any suspects can be identified.""  
  
The four leaks in the pipelines, which link Russia and Germany via the Baltic Sea, have become a flashpoint in the Ukraine crisis.  
  
The leaks occurred in international waters but within the exclusive economic zone of Denmark and Sweden.  
  
The damaged Nord Stream pipelines discharged huge amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into the air for several days."

Hungary at the moment has a culture of looking to the past, of reminiscing over what was once their great empire and their loss at the Trianon convention. Hungary are part of the EU but never really successfully caught on with exports and realizing opportunities trough trade and cooperations abroad. There are some minor exceptions like Budapest Tourism, the pronindustry  and WIzzAir. But if you travel to places like Debrecen, Nyigheraza etc you see they re staying behind, especially the smaller villages and cities surrounding them.

To give you an example when ordering a trainticket to Ukraine from Debrecen the person behind the counter still had to handwrite the details on the ticket.When entering the tourist information  of Debrecen – the second city of Hungary – people working there didn’t speak English,solely Russian and Hungarian. Thisis a reflection of howislated their worlds are. Hungary in general has the lowest speaking part of people able to speak English. The main reason having no interest in the outside world. Except for the more modern Budapest.

If you take a country like Ukraine they are taking big steps lately. Saw kids of seven that were already thaught English at school.

Also worth mentioning that proper history teachers point out to students that the Hungarian tribes that took control of the area did not go around on a genocidal rampage but the people living here assimilated naturally over time giving us a very diverse geenepool (pretty sure I mistyped that word). Also pointing out that this meant cultures molding together over time. A switch to Christianity also rapidly followed.

And just a few days later he has to repeat himself for whatever meeting this was or whatever purpose.

Give it a day or 2 and someone will either say Ukraine needs to negotiate OR someone will say Ukraine needs to negotiate on its own terms.

While the latter part of that is true, bringing it up constantly is due to pressure for Ukraine to negotiate and whoever is saying that is trying to reiterate that.

However, they ""offered"" to deliver gas via NS2, which would have been a diplomatic and strategic victory for Russia, because it would have meant that Germany would have to revoke its decision not to open NS2, and this would have been a crack in the system of European sanctions against russia. 

Under these circumstances, it totally makes sense for russia to blow up NordStream 1 (the one which was officially still in service) because then the only alternative for Germany to get gas would have been NS2. 

The russians bet on supply problems in Europe and generally overestimated european reliance on russian gas. Their gambling didn't pay off. 

And someone else mentioned that the explosions happened just a couple of days before a norwegian-polish gas pipeline was opened - and the pipes run just a few kilometres from the point where NS1 was sabotaged. This could also be interpreted as a silent ""nod"" to the norwegians and poles to remind them that their pipelines are not secure and can be destroyed at any moment. 

&#x200B;

On the other hand: Why would the US want to blow up a pipeline which isn't transporting gas, but which belongs to an allied nation? This would not lead to a single dollar of extra revenue, but the political fallout would be utterly desastrous if it came to light."

For the EU, when they entered, they offered very cheap labor and a new market place to sell products to. A problem EU has had for a while is demographic decline. They could always use more.

For NATO, it's geographical centrality in eastern Europe and proximity to the Balkans makes it easier to project power in that area of the world.

Even if was a Russian missile it wouldnt started WW3. No one is starting a war because of a tractor and two people.

The soviets shot down a korean airliner

Turkey shoot down a russian military plane

US shoot down a iranian airliner

Israel almost sunk a US ship

None of those things started a bloody war because all were accident. Just like hitting a border territory during one of the most massive attack on Ukraine of the war.

Whoever did, it did unintentionally and nothing should or will fucking happen.

The only thing to extract from this is to give better AA to ukraine.

If it was an ukrainian AA missile, Ukraime needs better AA so they dont fire in the wrong direction again

I moved away from Hungary but every day when I check the news I have a tight stomach because I know he will do something even more disgraceful and he is willing to sink much-much lower. But for me, it seems that Putin has something on him. Because he tends to make favors toward Putin and his allies even when those are illogical. In no way do I want to bring in conspiracy theories or anything. But in Hungary, after the end of communism, the agent files never were published. Which are a disgrace and a huge liability because those who had access could blackmail many people. Maybe this, or something totally different is in the background. But Orban was against the Soviet Union heavily and the turn he made at the time he made didn't seem logical. 

In no form, I can imagine that he would want actual land from Ukraine. Hungarian military is a joke and he knows that too. Also, those parts of Ukraine are one of the poorest. Hungary already suffering in many ways. He just likes to be relevant and that's why he shows gestures to the far right. Currently, he has the uneducated mass which is fueled with propaganda, and the far right which is 1/3 of the country, but it's enough to grant him absolute power. 

Also, Orban always worked in the EU as the bad guy but there were many cases when certain EU members wanted him to take the blame instead of them. In public, they could tell what they wanted about Orban, but always maintained his power and made many deals with him like Merkel did. Obviously, this is not relevant to this news,  but I would be curious to see that does this voices still exist or if he just actually believes that he is so big that he can do whatever he wants. I really hope the EU stops messing around and finds ways to screw him. But since they are actually negotiating with him about the delayed funds shows me that the EU is still not radical enough. We can't expect that he will fail by election or any form of revolution. Hungarian as a nation was beaten down so many times that people live in apathy and many people still do not understand democracy and how should that work. The transition to a democratic system wasn't something all of Hungary fought for. It wasn't earned, it was given because of other events. Therefore we are fucked and I hope the EU and NATO won't tolerate it any longer."

Who do they talk to?

Who do they meet?

What do they say?

Are they plotting against him?

Getting them to inform on each other.


Then he just keeps them off balanced, permenantly.  Every time thst somebody falls out of a window, has a helicopter crash, shoots themselves, has a sudden mysterious illness, has a heart attack.....  Nobody knows if it was suicide, an accident or if Putin ordered it.   He also sends people to the Lubyanka the old KGB HQ.  Where few people get out and nobody enjoys their time there.  Even if officially, Russia hasn't carried out an execution in some years. 

As for the people, there's always more space in the Gulags and more space can always be made.   And that's if you don't get sent to Ukraine, with a one way ticket. 

Even if you tried to execute Putin you'd have to find him and you never know if it's him or one of his doubles.  Jidt because somebody is chairing a meeting and looks like him, doesn't mean that it is him.  Like most dictators and particularly in his case given his ex-KGB origins and his vast personal wealth.  Estimated at over $200 billion.  The guy is paranoid and takes his personal security extremely seriously.   He won't want to end up like Saddam Hussein and getting tried and hanged on public TV.   He has guys collecting his faeces, when ever he travels abroad or away from home.  So that his DNA can't be collected and the identity and existence of his wife and children is a state secret.

Russia is running out of cash reserves.

From there imagine him ready to go against the power in place, there is only one step.

“*Yevgeny Prigozhin and Kadyrov are the force that will rule Russia after Putin*,” wants to believe Alfred Koch, a former deputy prime minister of Boris Yeltsin, now in exile. “*And Putin is alive and well only until this couple feels stronger than the army. As soon as that happens, they will have in their hands a snuffbox and a scarf \[a reference to the assassination of Czar Paul I in 1801\] and they will immediately arrive in Putin’s apartments.*”

Regardless of the seriousness of this prediction, Yevgeny Prigozhin’s rise is indeed causing significant resentment within the Russian military, not to mention the tenacious hatred he has for many FSB agents, the Russian security services, and the fear he arouses among the elite.

However, his posture remains very opportune for power. Such profiles have always existed during Vladimir Putin’s reign — radicals whose very existence is supposed to reassure, both internally and externally, the “moderate” position of the president.

Russia most definitely has a problem with not having enough people to fight.

This isn’t the Cold War. Russia isn’t the behemoth it was then. It doesn’t have Easter European countries to get manpower from. (Fun fact. 60% of the soviet army in WW2 was made up of Ukrainians.)

Europe alone has more men, tanks, ships, artillery and aircraft than Russia does.

Tiny Ukraine has fought Russia not only to a stand still,but is kicking them back.

There’s four possibilities to that ‘rumour.’

1) the hardliners who have been asking for it, but have no concept of reality have pushed for it.

2) Russia thinks they can use the threat to force Ukraine to negotiate. I.e give up the land it’s lost.

3) it’s a genius one rumour being spread because Russians can’t quite comprehend how bad they’ve performed.

Ah, so you don't know what ad hominem is. I thought as much.

""Ad hominem"" and ""insult"" are not synonymous, much as internet debate school may have taught you otherwise. Saying someone is a moron for making terrible arguments isn't (necessarily) an ad hominem argument.

Ad hominem is when you say someone is wrong because of something about them as a person, as opposed to some flaw in their argument. Hence the name - ad hominem is Latin for ""to the person"". For instance, say that you argued that Elon Musk was a genius businessman and I argued that you are wrong, citing his recent fumbling of Twitter as evidence. If you called me ""dunce"" - which appears to be the only insult you know - and said that I'm wrong because SpaceX and Tesla were great business ventures, that's not an ad hominem attack, even though it contains an insult. On the other hand, if you very politely say that I have no idea what I'm talking about because I'm not a billionaire businessman and therefore cannot comprehend Musk's genius, that \*is\* an ad hominem, even though there's no insult, because the veracity or lack thereof of an argument has absolutely nothing to do with who is making it, meaning the fact I'm not a billionaire is immaterial.

Any more extremely basic concepts I can clear up for you while I'm here?

>High scientific output is a metric of a ""golden age"". Its decline is function of the golden age ending

Um... yes?

Not sure if you didn't read my last response or just lacked the ability to understand it, but this isn't a refutation of anything I said. Yes, scientific stagnation is one metric by which you could mark the end of a Golden Age. Thing that both you and the article are missing, however, is that that doesn't mean that the lack of scientific output \*caused\* that end to the Golden Age.

In this specific case, there's a number of pretty easy-to-spot causes that resulted in both scientific decline AND the end of the Golden Era - specifically that all those Arabic nations that had been busily churning out scientific and cultural advancements over the last few hundred years suddenly found themselves in the midst of a series of military conflicts that rather dramatically shifted their priorities, culminating in the destruction of one of the most central and important cities of the medieval era.

I wouldn't think this is that difficult of a concept to understand."

1. She was not trying to ""smuggle drugs into Russia"", she was already in Russia and attempting to fly out of Sheremetyevo airport near Moscow.
2. The amount of hashish oil she allegedly had in her bags was a very small amount, certainly not more than enough for personal consumption. It was in a bottle smaller than the amount of shampoo you're allowed in a carryon in the US.
3. The Russian judicial system is incentivized to give her the maximum penalty for political reasons. She is less likely to be punished for what she did, but instead who she is.
4. This was a fairly regular trip for her, as she and another WNBA player had done so multiple years in a row.
5. The Russian government has been known to use US Citizens in political stunts.

Because of these factors, it seems that the majority of her situation was caused not by her actions but by the political situation. This is why I think it is the responsibility of the US government to intervene on her behalf and get her back to US soil."

No, that talking point is based on semantic gaslighting.  They may discuss the specifics of CRT in law school, but the ideology of CRT has altered the curriculum which now incorporates basic aspects of CRT.  Anyone that paid any attention is keenly aware of the changing narrative that occurred, from ""it's not being taught"" to ""it's being taught but it's just discussing race"" to ""it's just being honest about the past and impact on today"" back to ""it's not being taught"".

> like Florida’s dont say gay bill.

No such thing as the ""don't say gay bill"" exists, and the level of hypocrisy, considering your prior sentence about ""made up wedge issues"", is off the charts.  

>DeSantis misused federal covid funds, that could have been used to save more Florida citizens.

That's a lie.

>DeSantis Makes up issues to suppress minority voters.

That's another lie.

1668783367.0,iwutott,t5_30hhs,0,1,mtaw,0,"If (or when) Putin gets worried he'll be gone in a flash. 

Wagner's guys are mercenaries - they have no loyalty to him personally. And their actual numbers are far too small to match any of Russia's agencies. The Federal Guard Service alone outnumbers them, let alone Rosgvardiya, the ordinary police, FSB forces, the armed civil defense forces of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, and of course the regular armed forces.

Putin has use for Prigozhin because he thinks he 'gets stuff done' and isn't afraid to get his hands dirty, while not posing any real threat to Putin. He comes from the criminal world, not the political one or military or security services. 

As such he's got zero support in those circles. On the contrary the hate him. Besides the natural hatred that'd come in any situation where some outsider with no experience comes along and tries to convince your boss he can do your job better than you can, the Wagner guys have on occasion murdered Russian soldiers, murdered FSB guys. They know it, even if it's all been quietly 'dealt with'. 

To Putin that's all 'a feature, not a bug'. It means Prigozhin is totally dependent on Putin for his position. (and officially he has none at all, he's got no title, no Kremlin job, he's just a government contractor) On top of which you have the usual criteria for getting to the top, namely being corrupt. Prigozhin's entire wealth has been based off bribes and kickbacks with government contracts for his catering business. Like the rest of the Kremlin, he can easily be thrown into prison at any time on corruption charges without even needing to fabricate a case.

Prigozhin has a big mouth and loves media attention. But Russia is not a Western country where you can convert media attention into real political power. All power is with Putin. If he wants you in jail, or merely silenced, it'll happen instantly. 

That's not to say Prigozhin (like the rest of them) isn't constantly seeking to expand his power and influence. But this stuff is more of a charade for a one-man-audience, an attempt to convince Putin he'd be a suitable successor. Because Putin anointing him as successor is Prigozhin's only real shot at getting power. He's got no supporters anywhere else."

As for the logic of firing it... if command says fire 100 missiles... and your afraid of having your ass thrown in Jail for 10 years... you fire 100 missiles."

The only reason Ukraine has not been given ATACMS is because of Biden's National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan. He's the one who's consistently killed it due to some concerns Ukraine might strike Moscow. But keep in mind that for some time it seemed like Ukraine would've even get HIMARS... and now they have 30 of 'em. 

Anyways it's not clear that a long range precision strike weapon will really help Ukraine *that much*. It would let them strike deeper into the Russian rear but they can already do that pretty well. I suspect that Ukraine would much rather have more mortar vehicles,  more GPS-guided Excalibur artillery, and more armored vehicles (tanks and transports) and of course more air defense. That's what they really need to punch through Russian defensive lines. At this point ATACMS might provide some psychological value but it's not necessarily going to really change the game."

Both electrical and water infrastructure depend on each other, so disrupting one will impact the other as well. 

In that case, Europe (and especially Eastern Europe) might not able to handle such a big influx considering they are in midst of recession (and winter). Unfortunately Zelensky will have to negotiate a peace considering Ukraine has lots of elders, children and people with special needs who will be the worst affected in this. Even if Europe agrees to take in refugees, it would still be a logistical nightmare for Ukraine considering the evacuations.

Those MiGs will then be going to Ukrain. Supplying Ukrain with F16s directly will not be useful for several reasons. 

The main ones is that Ukrain does not have airfield infrastructure that will support the landing, takeoff and maintenance requirements and they will need to be a NATO member to keep their planes flying if they ever get in a war, since their own airfields will be bombed to bits and all they can do is evacuate their aircraft.

The second reason is that they currently have no pilots that can be quickly trained to fly the F16 competitively. 

The Gripen does not have the first problem, but it does suffer the second one.

Given these circumstances, there are a lot of good arguments to get them MiG right now and the Gripen will probably be the better choice for the ""near future"" once they can get their pilots trained and aircraft become available. I saw someone comment that South Africa has a bunch of them and can't afford them really.  South Africa has been choosing to remain neutral or support Russia in the UN so far, so I wouldn't count on those making it to Ukraine anytime soon."

As they point out, the Flap Lid B was there since early September at least. Meaning it's Russian, but _also_ meaning it's likely immobile/inoperable, since they wouldn't keep a valuable component of an S-300PU in one place that long. The fact that it apparently remained there after the Russian retreat would also be explained by that.

Having obviously failed to move it or destroy it when evacuating, this strike would most likely be to deny it to the enemy. Putting the footage out there and claiming it's Ukrainian anyway is what you'd expect from the Russian MoD propaganda guys."

There were polls for everything you want, especially in the 90s. You could buy any result. Nevertheless, I'm skeptical of the claim.

>Also those 1987 protests, why didn't they go anywhere?

Brutal repression. 

>They were protesting because they wanted more food or stuff, they didn't give a shit about freedom and ideology

That's BS. Freedom, ideology, and politics were discussed by most if not all Romanians. Discussing the political situation, and its implications, was typical and was done in every situation in which people felt safe to do it. Political jokes were omnipresent and sometimes even got through censorship (see Toma Caragiu).

Many people tried to get info from outside and listen to Radio Free Europe, and Voice of America.

>you can't say that everyone considered him a puppet of the soviets from the beginning

Ceausescu was never considered a puppet of the soviets, neither by the majority of Romanians nor by people outside of Romania who understood something about the situation.

>The soviets didn't help Iliescu in any way, but he was affiliated with them

That's a myth. Actually, this a myth probably created by the regime itself, as Ceausescu was not ""pro-soviets"", so if you want to discredit somebody, that was how you do it.

There is no proof he was an ""agent"". Iliescu had initially a good career in the party, almost too good. Ceausescu, and not only him, did not want to have people capable of replacing them, so he was sidelined. If they would have had any proof for him to be a soviet agent, he would have had a ""tragic"" accident. 

How the hell was he ""representing"" or affiliated with the Soviets when during the 80s at least, probably longer, he was under quite intense surveillance by the Securitate? The guy had always somebody on him, 24h per day, 7 days per week, and probably had more bugs in his house than an entomologist!"

I'm in Georgia, and there are regular protests outside the parliament in Tbilisi with people demanding the government take certain actions, but the government has its Russian supporters in it, and from what i see (being an expat, so not fully clear about the situation, getting most info from Georgian friends) it will have to wait for elections before there is a chance of change.

As of this point, power to major population centers has been restored within days after each attack.

It is one thing to knock out power in preparation for an impending attack, but it is a completely different undertaking to attempt to destroy the electrical system country-wide.

This is partially because the electrical system is overbuilt for peak demand. At least in North America, every house and apartment has a power hookup for people to cook, blowdry their hair, have an AC running, and boil water for tea, _simultaneously_.

So if the russians destroy the big transformer, the Ukrainian engineers can lower the line voltage, hook up a smaller transformer, and tell people to save energy by only using devices they absolutely need. And I believe that's what's happening.

In the end, an average household might have a 6-kVA hookup, but only needs 100W for LED light bulbs to light a home. and maybe 1kW of power to prevent the water lines from freezing (if heat is electric, which is not very common in Europe anyway.

Pump stations for water and sewage all have their own backup generator, at least where I live.

In order to bring down the electricity grid, russia would need to destroy a lot of electrical transmission towers, and even then Ukraine would probably improvise, convert long-distance power lines to High-voltage-DC, and run them underground. 

And every replaced transformer should get its own bunker. Ukraine IS getting billions of dollars of assistance from all of Europe and the US, Ukrainians are not alone."

You are trying to justify Russian imperialism of the present by pointing at the imperialism of the past. Russia is ***right now*** easing child labor laws because Putin's government has spent the past two decades running the population into the dirt, and made the problem even worse by getting a lot of the working age population killed and is sending many more to get killed. ***Right now*** the Russians are bombarding power plants to try and freeze an entire country into submission, are trying to engineer a both a food and energy crisis globally to try to convince the world to just let them have a country they couldn't take by force.

You are in fact trying to justify Russia making the Ukrainians suffer. That is the argument you are making. What you are saying is Russia is justified in what it is doing because NATO didn't do what it wanted. You're just too intellectually cowardly to see that is what you're saying. You're also factually wrong because NATO stonewalled Ukraine on membership for years specifically to appease Russia and the Russians still attacked Ukraine. Twice.

No one attacked Russia. NATO didn't have more than a token force in Eastern Europe before Russia kicked off this war. It didn't even have token forces there until Russia started trying to take chunks out of its neighbor. So in every respect, factually and ethically, you are dead wrong. You have no point whatsoever.

1668787746.0,iwv46if,t5_30hhs,0,1,nothra,0,"I believe the US has provided aid in the form of ""cash"". You can get a general idea from the Kiel Institute's Ukraine Support Tracker. Currently states around $15.2B in financial aid to Ukraine (compared to $27.6B in military and $9.5B in humanitarian aid).

In fact, I'd argue that this aid is of even more critical importance than the military aid. Putin, having failed with direct military attacks, has shifted to economic warfare hoping to bankrupt the Ukrainian state. This is actually an area where the White House has criticized the European allies for not acting fast enough. While the Biden administration has been quick to provide this critical aid, the Europeans have promised a lot of cash but provided very little of it to date. While I can understand some EU countries being unwilling or unable to provide military assistance, there's really no excuse for them not providing financial assistance.

That said, I am one of those ""crazy"" republicans who is very concerned about how this money is spent. I have seen no evidence of any wrongdoing and believe we should ramp up assistance in coordination with our allies, but I do believe we should take a hard look and make sure to have clear controls. Corruption is not an unknown problem, and it should be relatively straightforward (though certainly not easy) problem to solve. 

It's been over 6 months that the US has been supplying aid, we should have had time to setup such systems. In fact the US recently announced that they were able to convert Ukraine over to an inventory tracking system to help better track where the various military equipment goes. I personally have faith that the Biden administration is doing a good job with this, but I can totally understand why some people might be critical of this. The US government is not a paragon of anti-corruption itself.

That said, I'm not blind to the fact that some republicans like MTG and Trump are simply using this excuse for some alternate agenda. This complicates the very (in my opinion) legitimate argument on tracking aid."

Even if youdon't speak the language with symbols and handsigns you can get a long way. In UKraine when people didnt understand me they were still prepared to help.

that's a lie.

The language of the law demands that the ""life of the mother must be in imminent danger"", so if a woman is diagnosed with cancer, and happens to be 6 weeks pregnant, they can't start chemo until they are literally at death's door. This significantly impacts the recovery outcome.

The most generous interpretation is that the army guy didn't want to kill people on the streets so he decided to give the power to Iliescu, but there were some other shady incidents that indicate maybe it was planned for some time as some people in the security services saw the writing on the wall and decided to get rid of him.

There were some jokes but Romanians generally were thoroughly brainwashed. I've never met an old person that striked me as some kind of underground anti-communist resistance, they were very enthusiastic about the whole system, if they just gave them more food it's possible the regime would still be going strong, actually after Iliescu took power nothing really changed (actually he wanted to continue the ""communist"" thing but caved in due to popular demand) and it took like a decade for Romanians to learn what not being a stupid commie is all about, and some of them will never learn."

I didn’t know that and now I’ve got some reading to do. Thanks! I still believe Russia is on a weakening trajectory as far as military forces, instead of a strengthening one like the Nazis in the late 30’s.

I have to disagree on a few major points regarding the nukes. 

It’s a lot more reasonable to be “gun-shy,” as you say, when they are involved. 

Your claim that Putin isn’t deterred by them doesn’t really hold water. He seems very careful when dealing directly with NATO and other nuclear powers. For just a few examples, he showed restraint when Turkey shot down a Russian military plane. He didn’t do anything rash against NATO when the USA hit his ally Syria with cruise missiles, or assisted the Ukrainian people in overthrowing their Russian puppet government. He’s a thug when he gets the chance, but he’s still very careful around nuclear enemies, the same way NATO is.

I also doubt this idea that Russia somehow doesn’t have nuclear weapons anymore. It’s a very popular idea right now and the evidence boils down to two things:

“Nuclear deterrence limits some of the ways we could kick Putin, so it would be better if it didn’t exist.”

And

“Russia made the mistake of invading a mid-sized country that had been fortifying since their last war and had tons of foreign weapons, while not really upgrading Russian forces beyond peacetime levels. Russia is losing the current battles in that country. That means every part of their military must be totally ineffective.”

I don’t find that evidence convincing."

1. If the Russians can't hold the Dnipro, then they can't hold anything.
2. Every Russian move from here on is going to look disastrous, because every move will be designed to avoid an even bigger disaster.

Russia held on to right-bank Kherson as long as they could, because losing that ground puts Ukrainian artillery (HIMARS) within range of the Crimean bottleneck and the transport routes through Melitopol. Without these LOCs it is impossible to hold left-bank Kherson.

Left-bank Kherson is critical because of Ukrainian successes in targeting warships, and Russian failure in gaining air superiority. Without protection from Kherson, Crimea cannot reliably be resupplied by air or sea. The only remaining supply route for Crimea will be the Kerch Bridge, and Ukraine will be much closer going through the Sea of Azov than the Black Sea. To defend the Sea of Azov, Russia would have to use the Black Sea Fleet.

Regardless, Ukraine will eventually be able to attack the Kerch Bridge from left-bank Kherson. If the bridge is destroyed, then this begins a chain of strategic catastrophes for Russia. Ships in the Black Sea Fleet will be trapped by the destroyed bridge, either in the Black Sea or the Sea of Azov. If in the Sea of Azov, then I think Ukraine picks at them until they hide in Rostov-on-Don. If in the Black Sea then they can contribute to the defence of Crimea, but it's worse in the long run.

With Kherson under Ukrainian control, both seas contested, and the Kerch Bridge destroyed, defending Crimea becomes impossible. It also becomes difficult to extract troops and equipment from Crimea, preventing their use in the east (if that is still ongoing).

Whoever controls Crimea, controls the Black Sea. The threat of Neptune missiles from Crimea would force the remnants of the Black Sea Fleet to hide, either near Istanbul or near Georgia, with no hope of resupply. If Ukraine manages to develop an air-launched Neptune, or is given the air-launched Harpoon or similar, then the Black Sea Fleet will be forced out of the Black Sea, or destroyed. If Russia refuses to negotiate after Ukraine retakes all territory, then this is one of the levers NATO can use to force peace in Ukraine's favour.

I honestly don't think that Putin can survive the loss of Crimea and the Donbas region. Throw in some more irreplaceable warships at the bottom of the Black Sea, and another 20-30,000 dead Russians, and there's no way that he hangs on."

That's ridiculous.

I don't remember knowing many persons ""enthusiastic about the whole system"", maybe a couple ""enthusiastic"" about the power they thought they had. 

People knew the system is broken. Some people hoped it can be repaired, and made better from the inside (they got fewer and fewer in the 70s and 80s) some waited for the opportunity or hoped Ceausescu will die.

This increases the radius of destruction. For nukes specifically you want to create the Mach stem. A nuclear warhead is made by ""wrapping"" a nuke core in conventional explosives. It is of course much more complex then that but in essence, the conventional explosives along with a burst of neutrons from a neutron source create conditions needed for starting a massive fission reaction. Again, don\`t get me wrong. Even though it sounds simple, nukes are incredibly hard to produce and maintain due to tolerances that are needed. However, once you make one, it is simply the matter of detonating the conventional explosives around the core. It becomes just as simple as detonating a conventional warhead. That said, there are (i hope) many more safety features that prevent detonation in a nuke compared to a conventional warhead. The problem for me is that we are dealing with Russians here. We know that their nuclear arsenal is in terrible shape. We know that there are several factions within the Russian horde etc. That can present a problem."

Inflation has nothing or very little to do with with the reduction of business ""risk"" as you call it. 

We all seem that have short term memories. But If I recall, the previous administration was going all out to ensure all of our trade partners ""paid their fair share"". Meaning closing the trade deficit with China, and re-working the NAFTA agreement. 

This was done again in a very blunt matter. The imports from China were imposed a 26% tax. Across the board, with specific and coincidentally exemptions for Trump daughter line of fashion items made overseas (pure coincidence of course). 

Problem is, The Chinese government controls their central bank. Meaning they can (and have) re-adjusted their currency value as they see fit. Something the US Gov can not do. 

So when the US imposed a 26% tax, the Chinese re-adjusted their currency down by \~26% to off-set the tax. And the cherry on top of the shit-cake was that none (not a single one) supply contracts for goods imported are signed using the Chinese Yuan. They are all signed using the US Dollar.  Does not take a math genius to see what the results are. 

This meant that 100% of the tax cost would be passed on to the US consumers. So a automatic 26% increase in 99.9% of all goods sold at your favorite Walmart. Instantly.   

What delayed this impact on the COGS, was the pandemic. That instantly froze trade. Meaning the full impact of the 26% was delayed by 2 years. Until all the sudden, we are passed the last wave. And roaring to get back into it. And guess what! That 26% tax is still roaring as well. 

US Business hate $hit during COVID by dealing with lower demand for goods. But now its ""Time to pay up bitches"". 

And then we have the tax we imposed (and removed, and re-imposed, and modified, and re-imposed) on Aluminum & steel coming from Canada. That did quite a number on the beverage industry (aluminum Cans). One of the cheapest beverage packaging cost when up by 15% instantly. 

BTW, all Trump had to do, was lift these TAXES (tariffs). Even if it was just an interim action, say 12 months. But I don't think he could think that far. 

And for trade deficit. The correct action is to mandate an increasing and gradual minimum US made or assembled content for all good sold within this country. Meaning, Per example: APPLE would need to have a minimum of 10% of its parts or assembly labor made here (right now, nothing from APPLE is made in the US, amazing for a US company). And you increase that amount annually over time until you balance the trade deficit. It gives time for business to adjust, and creates jobs. I don't think the 26% tax created any jobs, but it is hitting tax payers wallets."

As am I, and he is involved in the culture war because as the governor he has to be.

>As for the don't say gay bill, the actual intentions and implementation of the bill are exactly that, teachers cannot even state their marriage status without possibly facing repercussions.

So it's as much a ""don't say straight"" as ""don't say gay"".  As a gay man, I'm offended for my sister-in-law who can't say she is straight... You're massively projecting, it's all projection.  This is why everything has utterly shifted, you define neutrality as oppositional, which means the only valid position isn't just acceptance but promotion.  It's dishonest.

>desantis and the Florida legislature still have not divested nearly $200 million of Florida's pension fund that is in Russian assets. He has failed to address this money laundering to Russian state actors.

Of course you link the Miami Herald, a paper that has repeatedly been shown to lie about Desantis.  Now do New York and a host of Democrat run states which has the same issue with investments in russia.  Oh that's different though huh?  What did russia specifically do when New York tried to sell its $300M in russian stock?  Ohh pushaw pushaw, russia blocked those sales in early March so they couldn't divest.  Ooops.  Besides, rushing to sell would violate the oath the trustees in control of the funds took, as the decision to sell right now isn't in the best interests of the funds, but who cares about oaths and the law right?  It's nothing but a virtue signaling move that directly hurts the funds and those they benefit.  As much as you'd like to think it is, reality isn't simple."

1668794013.0,iwvjr28,t5_30hhs,0,1,SLAVAUA2022,0,"Moldova-Transnistria: So this is an early one beginning of the nineties. Basically as soon Moldova became independent and wanted to put Romanian as the first language of the country,there was a big stir up of the Russian speaking part of Transnistria. Fearing Moldova would voluntairely be annexed by Romania. So Russia stirred up the conflict even more a revolution broke out  and send ‘peacetroops’ to settle the argument. What they actually did was make it like a frozen conflict as Moldova hardly had an army and couldn’t oppose Ruzzia. So the whole Donbass and Luhansk republics,it’sabout the same as what Transnistria is. Ruzzia even installed a general as the local dictator and made Transistria solely depended on itself economicly.  
One year later Ruzzia tried the same thing in Estonia with Narva,but Etonian politics was a little smarter in handling it. Ruzzian troops were also on Estonian soil. And they actally organized a referendum for it to break away: https://voxeurop.eu/en/the-little-russia-that-wanted-to-break-away/  
Then we have Belarus. Belarus began as one of the most promising former Sovjet states when it came to democracy and values. But had an election with Lukashenko who used his status as anti corruption clerk to gain trust with local people. Soon and slowly LUkahsenko was stripping Belarus from it’s values and freedom. He couldn’t have done it with the support of Ruzzia whome was the most important economic engine for the Belarus economy.So what Ruzzia basically did was make them economicly almost completely dependent of them. So Lukhsenko has to dance the dance Putin wants him to.  
Then we have Hungary. Hungary is a bit special. Basically in the nineties Hungary got overrun by the Russian mafia in their own city: Budapest. The Russians became the big player, the FSB has always used crimegroups as foreign agents aswell, so for them it was an extention to operate in Hungary. I’ve read one crimebook about the mafia in Europe in which a story comes to play where a source claims that Orban was already an asset of the FSB in the early nineties.   
It’s no secret that Orbans partymembers have meetings with the FSB https://budapestbeacon.com/direkt36-members-of-viktor-orbans-inner-circle-met-with-fsb-official-in-run-up-to-2010-election/ A former spy even informed  that Hungary was The FSB’s base of operations; https://www.voanews.com/a/former-spy-hungary-used-as-logistical-base-for-russian-intelligence-activity/4879742.html Nor shoud we be surprised that one of the sons o a high intelligence boss is staying safely in Hungary.

>making sure that no US government aid was put in there is prudent.

Those drones are usually not visible and cannot be heard from the ground once they are a couple of dozen metres up (at least not when there's background noise such as wind, people talking, guns blazing ...).

And that's good.

However, what if they installed speakers on those drones that would play a certain sound after the bomb had been dropped, such as screaming voices from hell or something similar? 

After a while everyone would associate this sound with bombs being dropped from invisible drones.

Then you could also send drones that just play this sound and everybody on the ground has to seek shelter because there could be a bomb... But you they never know. I imagine this could add quite a bit of psychological stress and impact, cost some sleep, nerves, and disrupt whatever they're doing."

Its not like he will hit the nuke button for missiles being shot down. I think we are to a point where this would be an appropriate action. It wouldnt even have to be over all of Ukraine, it could be over parts where Russia isnt able to fly anyways, and pilots could be given instructions not to engage manned aircraft unless fired on."

This significantly impacts the recovery outcome.

THAT'S a lie. She can still get chemo, so long as she doesn't tell her chemo provider that she's pregnant in the first trimester. In the second and third trimester, it's safe for the baby anyway. The law only covers the abortion procedure itself, so if she has a miscarriage, there's no way to prosecute her for it."
1668795257.0,iwvmsy2,t5_30hhs,0,1,mtaw,0,"Not sure many Ukrainians care to hear what Rice has to say. She's one of that group of US experts on the Soviet Union who only were able to see the Soviet Union in Russian terms, as a Russian empire which in the name of 'stability' and fear of nuclear proliferation and civil war and so on, should be allowed to continue to be a Russian empire.

And she had more culpability than almost any American in creating the current situation. She wrote the ""Chicken Kiev"" speech for Bush, imploring the Ukrainians not to declare independence from the Soviet Union. She had more responsibility for anyone of shaping the post-Soviet US policy of then looking the other way while Russia violated the sovereignty of countries they considered 'theirs'. Intervening in Georgia, Moldova, Tajikistan, Nagorno-Karabakh, etc.

There was never any 'deal' that NATO would not expand into ex-Soviet countries, there was never any 'deal' that Russia's 'sphere of influence' should be respected. But it's not strange the Russians seems to think so - thanks to Rice and her ilk, who'd adopted a Russian mindset towards Ukraine and other Soviet Republics, who believed that  Ukrainians want independence was just an extremist idea of ""suicidal nationalism"" - in _her_ words."

Or maybe you have no idea what people thought before 1989, how they lived, or what their hopes were. Maybe all you know is stuff you read, and you picked up because it fits your view.

I knew peasants too. I knew engineers, factory workers, and teachers. I knew people who spent much of their life in prison for political reasons or have been sent to the ""canal"" for trying to avoid military service. I met people who risked their lives to escape from Romania. I knew party members and even members of Securitate.

Old people only remember the good old times, and humans will find a way to be happy even in hell. 

But to think the majority of people then didn't know how broken the system was, or that they didn't care is just wrong. The revolution showed that people cared. This is why some people try to discredit the idea that people cared and have been able to change something, in the Revolution."

Those will need to be replaced and Lockheed has already received contracts to refill those stocks.

In this case, barrels wear out, recoil systems become soft as bushing wear, suspensions break, etc… if there are no spare parts to replace them, then that’s not Ukraine’s fault.

The Holodomor was part of the wider Soviet famine of 1932–1933 which affected the major grain-producing areas of the country. While scholars universally agree that the cause of the famine was man-made, whether the Holodomor constitutes a genocide remains in dispute.

How is pretty simple, they crossed the borders in the east and north (from Belarus). If you want to go back a bit further to 2014, Russian assets colluded with separatists in Crimea and the eastern part of the country. They organized and provided arms. Russian soldiers on ""vacation"" in Ukraine joined in the fight. They mounted a rebellion, then held a flawed referendum to become independent. 

The why is more complicated and we will never know exactly what was going on in Putin's head. There are several factors that probably went into his decision though. Ukraine was becoming more Western, and he was losing his influence in the country. He had tried putting in a puppet government, but that didnt work. Large natural resource deposits, including oil and natural gas, were discovered in the eastern part of the country and in the waters surrounding Crimea. There was talk of Western companies helping Ukraine develop these resources. These would be in direct competition to the resources Russia sold to the West, and to add insult to injury, they would use the same Soviet pipelines that Russia had been paying Ukraine to use. This may have been what led to the 2014 invasion. As a response to the 2014 invasion, Ukraine cut off the water supply to Crimea by building a dam. Russia had to then truck in water, which was extremely expensive. It also reduced the agricultural and industrial uses of the land in Crimea, which was creating some minor discontent with the citizenry. There was also still occasional fighting as the Ukrainian military made a regular effort to annoy Russia over the disputed lands, even though things had somewhat normalized."

The longer range is also not as big of an advantage as it seems, since it gives more time for Russian air defenses to kick in, and you are more likely to be wasting more expensive weapons. So you can either throw six missiles at closer targets that you are more likely to hit and have a potentially major impact on the battlefield, or throw one missile at a target that is less likely to hit and be a much bigger waste of resources."

>And which of those ""count"" as credible threats to Ukraine

pretty much anything with guns and missiles on it is gonna count as a credible threat. that includes the kilo-class subs since they're able to lob cruisemissiles from the torpedo tubes.

&#x200B;

>how many are actively at work in this war?

pretty much all of it in various roles. the landing class ships are handling supplies and logistics. they dock at kerch port to supply crimea. others make trips up to berdyansk and mariupol too. 

&#x200B;

the krivaks can function as short range air defense, since they've got 2 OSA sam systems in VLS tubes. they're pretty capable anti-submarine warfare ships as per their function. 

&#x200B;

the tarantul class corvettes are nasty little missileboats that can lob various cruise missiles and anti ship missiles from 4 horizontally placed missile tubes. they're in pairs of 2 on either side of the helm. 

&#x200B;

the buyan-M class has 2x4 VLS tubes that are capable of lobing onix and kalibr cruise missiles.

&#x200B;

Couple that with very steep and dramatic costs if they got caught. So, unclear benefits, almost certainly high costs. As such, if the US did blow them up, they shouldn't have, as doing so harmed their over-all interests.   

Meanwhile, Russia faces no real costs: they have plenty of other pipelines running to Europe that they could sell gas through, yet still refuse to do so. On the other hand, while the benefits didn't pay off, dividing Europe over supporting Ukraine would win them the war, which is all they care about. Immense benefits, very little cost, if Russia did not blow up the pipelines, they should have.

I understand in a contested air space it’s not as easy to use them in a traditional CAS or air assault function. But with Russia on the other side of Dnipier and in Crimea there may come a time in the not so distant future when Ukraine needs air assault capabilities and needs the ability to absorb a not insignificant amount of air frame losses.

Has Putin gotten so weak that Prigozhin sees his chance at possibly taking control through controlling the remnants of the military fighting in Ukraine? Putin may just see it as easier to let him keep saying the things he is to take attention and heat off himself, but I can’t help but think that Prigozhin smells the last throes of a dying dictator, Putin. Wagner is the only part of the operation that still has more positive views from mil-bloggers and pro-war parties back home and he seems to be living that up, while also making Putin’s time with the MoD that much harder and obvious.

Maybe I’m wrong? He goes from never admitting anything about owning Wagner to admitting everything and giving speeches and publicly calling out the MoD and just kind of doing whatever he wants bc he knows he can’t be stopped now. Kadyrov talks a lot too, but that’s just what he does. But if he decides to stick with Wagner over the MoD too, is there too much more they need Putin for? With the country in shambles?

She was also listed the first time as a horse rider in a tournament the same year the GmbH was founded: https://archiv.turnierauskunft.de/veranstaltung/361231006/statistik_a_reiter.php

The address that was formerly registered as the company's address is a fake address of another Reiterhof: https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ostenholzer+Str.+8,+29308+Winsen+(Aller)/@52.7319271,9.846071,321m

Also, I'd argue that it was a fake address with which she registered the company because usually there's a liquidator in place once a company goes broke (who handles potential debts for the next 5 years after the liquidation). But because there's no legal liquidator and there was not a lawyer registered either as the new owner of the company it's usually a hint that the Amtsgericht realized that the address was fake when it was registered. That takes two years because there's a latency of the legal process once the required Handelsregister report for the first financial year hasn't been published (+ 6 months time to hand in the report later, + 6 months for legal process).

Also, I'd say that every company involved in ""Horse Management"" is a potential money laundering operation. But that's just my personal opinion."

Before the great WOII, the Poles had shaped their country and  it mainly consisted of the current eastern Poland combined with parts of the current Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine. So at the aftermath of WOII, Germany lost terriroty. Mainly Stalin demanded eastern Parts of Germany for Poland and at the same time other parts where Poland had presence \[eastern part of Poland\] were appointed to other countries. One can jokingly say that Poland was a country on wheels and it was pulled more to the West. As a conclusion the Poles were thrown out of some parts the current Ukraine and Belarus and they were appointed the lands of eastern Germany and kicked out the Germans. Places like Danzig became Gdansk for example.  
The side effect of this all was that the Poland became a very pure ethnic country because only Poles were living in the new country.Until this day it ranks on the top of the world  of most dominant ethnic ethnicity in one country. If I am not mistaken Bolivia is also one up there. Thus in this huge land were only Poles are living there wasn’t the room for Russia to stir up Russian sentiment of Russian minorities still living there. 

  
Other reasons also stem from history, Poland has always had bad relations with Russia.Lets first get to the sneaky way Russia and Germany signed a truce and in the sidelines made a pact to devide Poland. This whole sentiment hits home hard with the Polish now because they see the same trickery happening in Ukraine now. Russia early this year on the borders with Ukraine claiming it wouldn’t attack and were just doing some training, and Russia trying to takeover Ukraine and erase Ukrainian culture in the process.  
 In WOII there were a few incidents like the Katyn massacre, a place were the Sovjets excecuted more than twenty thousand Polish military men. Also when the Polish were fighting of the Germans, Stalin ordered his army to wait and not help the Poles.He was watching in a distance how his one enemy Germany was fighting against his other future enemy Polish nationalists whome he deemed a potential future threat.The Poles saw  this as the ultimate treason.

If you go back longer in history you will find even more reasons why the Poles dislike Russia.   


Lastly there is the whole security issue. The Polish don't want Russia at their border, they see the whole risk. Poland has been integrating much better in the EU and bisunesses are interlinked with the EU. This has brought a growing economy and relative wealth. The Poles no damn well what happen with their economy or culture once their Russian friends return. Hungary for the other part is much more dependend on Russia for their economy."

 My point is - this ""lets understand our enemy"" mind exercises are fairly useless. Yes - to a point it is useful to predict how our enemies will react in certain situations - but when it devolves to ""Russians are humans too. They are not smarter or dumber than you and I."" type of thinking - then we crossed from trying to win a war to trying to figure out who we should be more sorry for. And that's nonsense only philosophers and psychiatrists have time for.

 All we need to know here is - how long will the Russian people continue obediently sending their kids to the slaughter? If - like for the Germans in WW2 - the answer is ""Until total defeat"" - then Milley is right and we probably need to get  some sort of peace deal in place, possibly without Ukraine getting back Crimea - as the alternative is a decade+ of war and the West would have to fund it the entire way as Ukraine is unable to. If - on the other hand - Russian society is about to break - then helping Ukraine with weapons is the way to go.

 In reality - the answer is probably somewhere in between and while Russians might tolerate more mobilization now - their situation is getting worse and worse as they lose military equipment and their economy suffers. Where is the point of no return for them? WW1 style defeat with millions dead and a large chunk of Russia under occupation? Or something as small as Afganistan - with a fraction of soldiers lost - but 9 years of going nowhere?"

Like, imagine if in 1942, the Republicans had won the election and decided they needed to ""audit"" the US military. Whatever your views about civic responsibility, during the middle of a war is just not really the appropriate time to be hyper-scrutinizing of how funds are being allocated to fight that war.

The US government owes money to itself when it runs a deficit. Again, sans 10 years in the ENTIRE HISTORY of the country - we have ran a deficit.

But to address the national debt...

The super majority of the national debt is held within US borders by US companies who have an incentive to keep the economy going.

And for the rest of the world buying our dollars...

They will keep buying them because the US is the leading economy coupled with the fact that the most sought after resource, oil, is traded in greenbacks.

And countries keep the greenback valuation high by Petro washing their oil sales. This is why the US government pushed OPEC so hard to trade in greenbacks so soon after the Bretton Woods agreement where we ceases to use the gold standard. 

Now, I'll admit that if oil ceases to be traded in greenbacks then the US is probably fucked. But our military industrial complex works well to see that not come to fruition.

It's also probably why neither democrat nor republican is really **that** keen on seeing green energy replace oil. Not unless we can figure out a way for electricity to be traded in greenbacks, internationally."

At the same time Clinton and Obama were extremely eager to “reset” the relationship with Russia after the war in Georgia to the extent that they helped set the stage for the events of 2014. People on the left mocked Mitt Romney for calling Russia one of the world’s biggest strategic threats."

Benton, an aid bought a ticket and essentially scalped it to a Russian. If you have more, I’d like to read it. But this is clickbait headlines that don’t match the article. 

“Jesse Benton, a former top aide to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and former Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas), was convicted Thursday of helping a Russian citizen illegally funnel a political donation to former President Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Benton, 44, purchased a $25,000 ticket to a September 2016 Republican National Committee event for Trump and gave the ticket to Russian multilevel marketer Roman Vasilenko. Vasilenko then gave Benton $100,000.”"

According to SPIEGEL information, planning errors in the ordering of spare parts are increasingly jeopardizing the operational readiness of German self-propelled howitzers in Ukraine. Following the delivery of a total of 14 self-propelled howitzers 2000, the German Ministry of Defense had failed to order extensive spare parts packages in time to regularly maintain the weapon systems and thus keep them operational.

In the meantime, a large part of the artillery systems supplied by Germany is in need of repair due to intensive use on the front in eastern Ukraine. According to Bundeswehr sources, the Ukrainians are currently firing around 300 shells a day, which is severely wearing down the weapon systems. 

Six German howitzers were recently brought to Lithuania for technical overhaul. However, since the necessary spare parts for the howitzers were not available either from the industry or from the Bundeswehr, the technicians had to cannibalize one of the howitzers and leave it in Lithuania for the time being.

The lack of spare parts does not come as a surprise. In late summer, the Bundeswehr's procurement office had already unsuccessfully urged the ministry to order extensive spare parts packages for the howitzers and the Mars II multiple rocket launchers, since the special material had long delivery times. So far, however, no corresponding instruction has come from the so-called Special Staff Ukraine.

The lack of spare parts is now also paralyzing the so-called repair hub that Germany plans to set up in Slovakia by mid-December to repair weapons delivered there."

They don't care to deal with western heat on this, and the west doesn't want to deal with China buying discounted Russian hydrocarbons. China has been publicly declaring the annexation/war as incorrect, yet on Chinese state media they will cater to Russian propaganda points. Xi could give a fuck whether Ukraine is defeated or not, and does not care what happens to Russia so long as China comes out ahead. The CCP under Xi has always been very pragmatic and held a China (CCP specifically) First policy. China will not 'drop' Russia unless they do something untenable like use nukes, and even then it would only be to avoid heat and potential sanctions from the west.

Russia's protracted failures have thus far done nothing but benefit China. The longer Russia has to sell petroleum at massive discounts to China, the better. Xi would probably like to see this last as long as possible."

Yeah, but the flipside to this is that not every single American who went to fight World War II died there. Most of them came back. There's no guarantee that every single Russian man who left will go back, or even that a majority of them will. It really depends on what the political and economic outlook for Russia looks like at the end of the war. 

Plus, don't forget that Russia is also losing a lot of people at war as well, so the number of people who leave and don't return in order to dodge the draft isn't representative of the entire population loss. At a certain point, the population loss is unsustainable, especially in a country that was already facing demographic decline. 

The other thing to consider here is that the US had a huge economic boom straight after World War II. They still had their manufacturing capabilities while a lot of European countries took years to rebuild their economies. There was also the postwar baby boom, which isn't guaranteed to happen in Russia. 

This isn't going to be the case for Russia. Even if they are able to take and hold large chunks of Ukrainian territory, they're still going to be a heavily sanctioned country for decades. That isn't just a recession, that really could be a spiral. Don't forget that sanctions don't just go away after a year or two, and a lot of the countries currently sanctioned by the West (like North Korea and Venezuela) probably would be wealthy countries otherwise. 

Essentially, they're facing something that isn't just a recession; it could easily be an economic death sentence. I probably was being a bit hyperbolic suggesting the Russian economy is imminently going to spiral, but I think it will happen eventually anyway."

A perfect storm is happening inside China right now, and no one even needs to lift a finger, because they’re causing their own demise. And by that I largely mean the CCP in its own cocky, arrogant, but ultimately short-sighted view. Its lack of due diligence is coming back to bite them, big time.

We tend to forget that turning from a castrated, demilitarized pretend peace continent to a military might capable to carry it's own weight was never going to happen overnight and that status quo was largely the result of US interference I might add.

So I stick with my point that the response to Russia was the responsibility of the US, that's the situation that they created in Europe, as such they failed to preserve their own creation.

Also you have to remember, Europe rising means inevitably that the US will have another pole to compete with, one that is actually as advanced and actually capable to compete, unlike China and Russia, so one could argue it is not in the interests of the US for the EU to become competent, but thats another discussion all together.

Sanctions are designed to weaken a state and their capacity to continue doing whatever it is the state(s) issuing sanctions wish them to stop doing. They can be applied to weaken the power of the ruling party yes, but to say their direct application is to undermine their support by fucking the people about is a bit misplaced.. they're usually applied to autocracies and dictatorships, and we're not exactly swimming in examples where sanctions have brought them down. What we do have examples where a state's capacity for harm has been reduced.   


Kicking some kid out of his school and out of the country based on who their father is doesn't do anything to reduce Russia's capacity for harm, it's merely a vindictive action based on a series of assumptions."

The new aid will help Ukraine pay government salaries, pensions and fund social programs necessary to avoid a worsening of the humanitarian crisis caused by Russia's invasion of its southwestern neighbor.

Currently, best case scenario is Putin can withdraw and Ukraine will get its areas back. Putin might be humiliated but he can atleast say he got defeated by NATO backed Ukraine and may preserve his seat. Alternatives to Putin aren’t much different from him, so NATO isn’t gaining much from having him replaced. This also means that Russia would be a bit weaker but still stable, which you want for the nation holding the highest number of nuclear weapons (5977 as per latest American estimate)

However, if Ukraine attacks Russian territory, the Russians won’t think like “Oh no. They attacked us. Let us stop attacking them”. They will instead increase the attacks and when soldiers on front realise their home is in danger from NATO backed Ukraine, they will fight with more spirit. Currently, the Russians are lacking that. Injecting it isn’t helpful. If Russia goes down the revenge route, it can’t stop unless it reaches a very low point or Ukraine is destroyed. Neither is a good scenario since an unstable Russia with that many nuclear weapons would become an existential crisis to the entire world.

Also, Ukraine attacking occupied Ukraine territory will be viewed differently from Ukraine attacking Russian territory. Countries will happily provide resources and weapons for defence but if you want resources to go attack the country with most number of nuclear weapons in their own lands, you will have a hard time getting those."

> &quot;In this situation, we have every reason to reconsider our arrangements,&quot; Brigadier General Jari Tolppanen of the Finnish Border Guard agency told AFP. Some 200 kilometers of the 1,300-kilometre border would be fenced at a cost of around 380 million euros, the border agency said.

Its mostly worked out, is the thing. Most countries that joined the EU became more democratic and more aligned with EU values, and broadened most countries that got accepted into the WTO began a process of social and political liberalization. For all the talk of Democracy on the decline if you average it out Democracy and Free Trade has been well in the lead for raising living standards and human rights. 

The Ukraine war is an example of this- Russia counts only a few basketcase countries as real allies, and even acknowledging the sizeable amount of countries that profess neutrality in the conflict, nearly all comply with broader sanctions to some degree against Russia while steering well clear of actually supplying anything they could use against Ukraine.

So we become unjust (however small) without any benefit whatsoever for the sake of it?

>Would you consider the exclusion of the Russian Football Federation from FIFA and UEFA competitions as vindictive or a reasonable response?

Sport is used by nations to project their influence (hence Russia buying the world cup in 2018 and having state-sponsored cheating at the Olympics for decades). Expelling Russia denies some of their ability to do this, so it is a perfectly reasonable response in line with the nature of sanctioning in order to weaken a state.

>Gary Kasparov said sanctions should be broader and more generic even if it impacts himself. 

In order to weaken the state, not solely to fuck around individuals who're playing no active part in it at absolutely no benefit to any particular cause.

>The problem you and many others have is trying to apply western ideologies of fairness to Russia.

All you know about me is that I don't believe in doing things for no reason other than spite itself. You've merely said this in an attempt to discredit my opinion rather than make a genuine observation about imposing ideology as understanding the culture of Russia plays no part in my views on this other than knowing it would have *zero* impact on the state or the people's support for Putin. Why diminish ourselves (even slightly) for no reason?

The United States could easily supply enough materiel to crush Russia in a number of months. The reason they don't want to do that is political - and from the viewpoint of world stability, I believe the correct choice. Putin has backed himself into a bad corner where he's stuck, but not panicked. He can't justify nuclear weapons or extreme escalation, but he also just has to suck up the punishment being slowly doled out.

This is why it is in bad faith. It is impossible to check every cent we allocate in the US so why should we expect 100% perfection from Ukraine? Remember, their government has a lot to deal with right now so do they have the resource to triple check each company that funds are allocated to?

They want the wall for about 10-20% of the border's length, in the southernmost part which is most accessible to illegal crossing. No-one's requesting it for the long, extremely remote stretches in the north.

Based on what study? There are entire countries where this paradigm doesn't work, and even in the US there are a lot of single issue voters who largely don't agree with the candidates they vote for. I know people who are pro union, pro Medicare for All, pro social safety net but they vote Republican because they are very pro 2A. I'm sure there are plenty of old time union folks who vote Democrat because they are pro Union, but they are uncomfortable with LGBTQ people, they go to church every Sunday, and they are worried about immigration. Countries like China are very conservative socially but operate a social state. The same goes for many oil rich countries too, like Saudi and the UAE. It even breaks down when you look at the US as a whole! We are a relatively liberal country, yet we have weak protections for organized labor, low taxes, and no national healthcare system."

There is one ground-level video of Ukrainians in the process of detaining Russian soldiers as prisoners. One of Russian soldiers, rather than surrender, starts shooting (that's a war crime, perfidy, by the way). Then that video ends, that's all it shows.

Then there is a second video, taken from a drone of the Russian soldiers in the same place and largely in the same positions, but now clearly dead. That's all that video shows.

What happened to the dead soldiers is somewhat unclear. Perhaps they were actually killed by their own fellow soldiers during the firefight. Or (more likely) caught in the crossfire of the fire fight. Or killed by Ukrainians. We don't really know.

Because there is no video of them being killed - CONTRARY TO THE TITLE OF THE THREAD!!!"

> The audit, which will examine funds allocated by the Joe Biden administration to Kyiv, will begin in January 2023, when Republicans take their seats in the House of Representatives.

> Republicans have been divided on the issue for months, with Kevin McCarthy&#039;s camp in favor of reviewing aid to Kyiv and Mitch McConnell&#039;s in favor of additional aid to Ukraine.

> Green referred to remarks by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who earlier said Republicans would not send a &quot;Blank check&quot; to Ukraine in response to criticism in his party over US aid.

1668814947.0,iwwxdkr,t5_30hhs,0,1,Maxievelli,0,"No, the US doesn’t have a continuous carrier presence in the Med although there is always a CGN or something there.  They have 2-3 carriers continuously deployed but a lot of the times just pass through the Med on the way to Indian Ocean or Persian Gulf.  It’s not unusual to see a U.S. carrier passing through the Med but it’s unusual to see two of them at the same time.  

Also highly unusual to see simultaneous deployments of the European carriers.  While they are, of course, all in Europe, they usually reside in their home ports and venture out to make a show of force or participate in humanitarian missions.  The QE in particular is usually in Britain.

More importantly than having all those carriers active in the Med (which is already kinda crazy) is having the baddest (bestest) ship from each navy active in the same area at the same time.  The QE is the pride of the British Fleet, same with the De Gaulle to the French and the Cavour to the Italians.  For each of those countries they have deployed their largest military vessel.  The U.S. has deployed the Gerald Ford, for which the newest class of carriers is named and is basically the pride of its fleet and the largest of the 11 U.S. carriers, as well as the GHWB which is one of the most modern Nimitz-class carriers (having been built last).

Each of these countries has put their greatest Naval military asset out to sea (ready for combat).  That is not the usual state of affairs, even for a major military exercise.  

As a note: it further emphasizes (to Russia) how far they have fallen as a naval power.  They sold one Kusnetsov-class carrier, a fire broke out on the other, their navy is no longer capable of fielding carriers basically.  A major point of contention in the Russo-Ukrainian War was the port of Sevastopol in Crimea.  A primary reason to seize this from Ukraine was so Russia could regain the only ice-free deep water port the USSR had.  All these NATO countries rolling around with their carriers is not only an impressive display of displacement and force, but also a big “fuck you” to a country that longs for power projection."

“Zelensky’s defiant address set the tone for the conference in Halifax, a major annual gathering that brings together key officials from democratic nations and activists seeking a democratic future for their countries.”

“The gathering this year is focused on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its aftermath, with conference documents and paraphernalia adorned in Ukraine’s national colors of yellow and blue.”

“Russia will find no sympathy here, as Western and current and former Ukrainian officials will discuss in public and in private how best to aid Kyiv in its moment of need.”

“Those conversations will now be impacted by Zelenskyy’s clarion call for continued resistance to Russia, even if Moscow wants a break.”

“Peace is possible,” Zelenskyy said, “but for it to exist, we must make impossible Russian aggression [in] all of its elements. Let it happen. Let there be peace.”

Ending Russian aggression makes peace possible.

Let it be so.

Agree about blameless. There was a UA guy with a belt-fed LMG prone on the ground with all these Russian guys lying down in his ""beaten zone"" in front of the gun. As soon as the Russian idiot came out shooting, the poor UA gunner does the only thing he can in the circumstances - hold down the trigger on the LMG. Overpenetration of the 7.62x54R rounds kills these Russians immediately, before the UA guy can even aim that LMG anywhere else. Pure reaction. Anyone who has ever manned an LMG knows this is exactly how this would have gone, because the gun is 12kg of heavy steel and you can't just instantly point it in a new direction especially when lying down using the bipod."

That artillery piece began its development during the cold war, yes. So that means it was originally expected to have a fully up and running military-industrial complex supplying a large scale war.

But in 1991 the Soviet Union fell and the Cold War was over so began the long draw down of Western militaries because they weren't expecting a shooting war at any minute. So the suppliers of artillery parts and ammunition also draws down production to peacetime levels.

Then the artillery piece gets to see actual combat after 9/11, using up stocks but not at such a rate that the supplier can't keep up.

Fast forward to now, the Ukrainian military is firing 7000 rounds of artillery every day, dwarfing the typical supply needs of any Western military and as such, requires a time period of retooling, retraining and expanding the industrial base to supply the parts and ammunition for said artillery.

No actual evidence that the rest were shot. Let alone that they were deliberately executed. They were in between the idiot that came out shooting and the SAW the Ukrainians had covering the affairs so I wouldn't be surprised if a couple of them caught some bullets when the Ukrainians tried to take down mister,  ""I'm going to commit perfidy,"" but that's not the same thing as a deliberate execution."

The problem is the tubes, if the tubes bend, start to crack from pressure, wear down due to too much firing, or the breach block goes awry like not sealing that’s when problems arise. 

In this case the barrels are probably worn out, and need to be removed and rebored or resleeved depending on how severe it is, and how each particular gun is handled. 

All of which was at one point done in Ukraine with their own tubes, sadly they don’t have the tooling or machines for western maintenance most likely as it’s different standards and specifications. Outside that… hydraulic system repairs, track repairs, recoil systems can be taught quickly and easily.

Edit: how do I know. My dad was an artillery man and worked around both systems, suspensions break, recoil systems break. The tubes are where it becomes specialized and beyond the average crews reach."

When the chips are down and someone is shooting at you from less than 5 meters and you have a machine gun, what do you think is going to happen? Do you think he is going to do a single burst? going to spend a much of time to aim? They are going to hold down the delete button in hopes of saving their lives. In that circumstance, they are running at 110% adrenaline. This is one of the most high-stress environments that a person could ever experience in their lives. Outnumbered, close quarters, and military-grade equipment, make for a really bad spot to have anyone in. I think it's shameful that you lay judgment without having the full story. None of us have the full story, but I think it is disingenuous for you to sit there and make false equivalencies, deciding that you know what happened. Then blame people as holocaust deniers when they disagree with your perspective. This is the messiness of war. No do-overs, no second lives, no second chances, no pistols at dawn, or thinking it though. This is high power fully automatic weapons and split-second life-or-death reactions. 

The men on the ground were not searched yet. They were not secured, and They were not processed or removed from a combat area. They were surrendering. Until someone wasn't. That turned it into a gunfight with 600 rounds per minute of death. It's going to be messy and regrettable. But war is messy and regrettable. It's a goddamn shame. I feel for those boys. I feel that they should leave Ukraine and go back to Russia so that this can end. But they are the invaders, and they pulled the trigger. The ones I feel the most for are the Ukrainians that decided to risk it all to save these men. They could have just pounded that spot to oblivion with artillery until the few that were left might have made it out missing arms and legs. They went in and offered peace to these invaders, and some of them died or at least came close to it, putting their lives on the line to take these men.

A) Guy with weapon is shot, all those on the ground remain down and don't move/panic or whip out their own weapons. No further fire.  
B) Guy with weapon shot, some/all of those on ground produce weapons or attempt to charge/flee/stand. Immediate fight results in deaths, soldiers on ground panic as those next to them are killed either from stray fire or due to aggression.

I can't really imagine a situation where the Ukrainians, in cold blood, simply shoot every man on the ground - unless a few of them attempt to attack or aggress/panic in some way.

And it is not even showing all parts of it. There was a death strip, armed watch towers monitoring the whole border area, fixed lines for dogs to patrol, human patrols, ditches, tripwires with automatically shooting machine gun fire, the whole area lighted and so on.

The Wall or fence is the last instance to _slow down_ people trying to flee over the border, the last chance to shoot them. It is not meant and can't stop people who really want to get over or through it, but it gives the border guards an a bit longer time frame to act."

My opinion is that both US and EU are skizophrenic about NATO.

One side of the US wants EU to have an army/defense that can deal with all the threats EU may have to face (or much closer to be on par with US), which would means EU would not need the help and protection of US anymore. But the other side of the US also want to keep the hegemony and dominance over NATO command and strategy and be the ""power player"" in europe.

Part of the EU wants to save on army/defense costs (especially since the Berlin's wall fell and the end of USSR), because objectively the threats EU has to face aren't has big as how a powder keg europe was in the late 19th and 20th centuries, conveniently using the shield prodvided by the US (at US cost), satisfying US desire to be the dominant power over the old continent. But the other part wants an EU army independant from NATO to conduct deployments and operations without the need to consult anyone. 

The two sides of each actor is mutually exclusive. But each actor want both. Skizophrenia. 

As an historical point, this Europe and US skizophrenia, the ""europeanisation"" vs the ""atlantisation"" of the defense, is one of the many reasons (some being understandable from a sovereignty point of vue, others being much more dubious) why France decided to get out of the integrated command of NATO in 1966 ant stopped providing troops to the alliance (though was still under the mutual defense pact). Reintegration is quite recent : 2009. And France idea hasn't changed : France want an EU army that is independant of the US and NATO (and France want to be in the military lead of europe... so not an innocent idea at all).

At the end, i'm thinking is intensive re-militarisation of Europe, to get rid of US dominance and presence on the continent, is really a good idea ? When I look at how much far-right have grown up all over the european continent during the last 40 years, I'm not sure I want to see in 2040 Poland, Italy, France, Germany, etc, all armed to the teeth, ready to fight anything, and led or widely influenced by far-right whou would surely agitate the nationalism, the patriotism, the racism, and the revengeful warlike spirit..."

But this is recoverable and maintainable. I would be shocked if we don't start seeing mass-produced wood stove kits show up all over the country. And by the millions. Add a Peltier cooler, a fan, and a battery to it and you can have heat, cooking, and power enough to get by. There is coal, wood, and oil everywhere and millions of tons can be shipped in. Heat for cooking, water sterilization, and warmth is the number 1 priority and fire is the answer to that. Batteries and generators will be shipped in as well in greater and greater supply, and installations will get more and more elaborate. I suspect that we will begin to see large fences and screens/netting being erected around high-value targets. This is the same as bombing campaigns of old and new challenges mixed in. The situation always gets worse before the solutions start showing up, but necessity is the mother of invention and they will get what they need. Russia can go to hell, but Ukraine will be recovering by Christmas unless I miss my mark. Oh, and expect to see at least $100 million worth of transformers and electrical supplies showing up every month from here going forward. Bombing campaigns historically strengthen resolve.

The Pzh2000 was designed for a war not too dissimilar from this, but with the assumption of full supply and logistics chains, replacement and field attrition.

This has, obviously, been reduced over 30 years of peace, and I am honestly surprised there were any in circulation at all.

At the end of February and throughout Spring, the Hungarian government was one of the first to officially open its borders to Ukrainians. 

Fidesz voters usually support Orbán because they are anti-LGBT or anti-immigration or even anti-Brussels (Brussels being the one that forces gay rights and immigrants on Hungary).

Thats not really what a pardon is, In fact a pardon is technically an admission of guilt.

BUT, there was a very important claim if true, which seems to support Zelenskyy.

>Pieces of Russian missiles and a Ukrainian interceptor missile were found at the impact site in Poland

So 2 Russian missiles plus a Ukrainian interceptor?!?

Some early posts during the attack mentioned were saying 2 Russian missiles. If true, the simplest explanation for all this seems to be the interceptor(s) exploded in the air and caused both Russian missiles to go down and explode when hitting the ground.

Thus, NATO could claim the Ukrainian interceptor caused the explosions (to occur) in Poland (instead of Ukraine), and avoid escalation to a direct conflict.

Fidesz voters usually support Orbán because they are anti-LGBT or anti-immigration or even anti-Brussels (Brussels being the one that forces gay rights and immigrants on Hungary).

The tritium powers the fusion portion of a hydrogen bomb.  The original Atomic bombs were, for lack of a better word, inefficient.  The thermal nuclear and later hydrogen bombs combined really good understandings of physics with material science to increase that efficiency thus substantially increasing yield.  That all said, modern thermal and hydrogen bombs generally still start the chain reaction with a good old fashioned ""inefficient"" fission event that is unlikely to have decayed to a non-working state.  Remember the hydrogen isotopes like deuterium and tritium are added with plutonium and u235 and u238 in layers around that u235 initial fission event with the goal to raise the efficiency from ~2% of Hiroshima to better than %20 (guessing here, but given the efficiency of early fission weapons has be released as high as 17% and the only other docs i can find about newer stuff basically says ""significantly more efficient than stand alone fission"". I think >20% a safe conservative guess).  They accomplish this extra efficiency by basically stacking fision and fusion reactions to make more neutrons to re-fission the original fusion core releasing more energy triggering more fusion to make more fission so on and so forth until designers ran out of room in the bomb case. 

So what's the TLDR?  The hydrogen isotopes decaying will lower the efficiency of the reaction and may even prevent the expected cascade reactions, but we'll still very much have the initial fusion reaction.  Thus they will most likely go boom, but will probably ~only~ be an inefficient fission event.  Hiroshima's pure fission bomb was 15KT in size.  The hydrogen fusion bombs tzar Bomba or bikini atoll were 50MT or 15MT respectively.  

For some added relief, I'm guessing the half dead tritium, and unused fissile plutonium/uranium boosters will probably just be finely spread and float about on the wind as nuclear fallout."

FYI, you also have to be extremely careful when parsing French claims of “aid” before the war. Instead of actual aid like training 23,000 soldiers before the war, and donating Javelins and other lethal aid, they include arms sales as “aid” like the sale of French military helicopters.

The reason for a longer range, more expensive munition is so you can hit targets beyond the range of standard GMLRS rounds. Also, this comes with the inevitable trade off of having lower munition capacity because larger munition size. 1 ATCMS vs 6 GMLRS.

So why would you ever want to go in with a single ATACM vs 6 GMLRS rounds on a HIMARs, unless your target is beyond the 130km range of a GMLRS?

EDiT - it's like comparing a 9mm pistol vs a .338 lapua rifle. Apples and oranges... and depends on use case...

If there is e.g. a 220kV transmission line, and hypothetically the last available transformer at the substation was destroyed in an attack, but there's 50 110kV transformers available on a short notice, then there is no reason why the 220kV line couldn't be used as 110kV transmission line with the available parts, if properly configured.

Of course this would mean reduced transmission capacity, but even a quarter of normal capacity would be sufficient for normal residential use, if people are smart in their energy usage. 

Lights, radio, computer are ok, but e.g. blowdryer, electric kettle, and a daily bath are not necessary for survival in war time conditions.

I was writing that because there had been an earlier post about some indispensable transformer that got destroyed and people were going like ""Whelp, I guess we'll die now"".

Germany doesn't have spare parts to supply, it happens, as I stated earlier Germany didn't plan to ever see a full scale war in Europe ever again, and that's an admirable thing they hoped peace would be long lasting, they probably had enough parts stocked for 2-3 months of short term warfare and that's it, since that's what most wars were in years, short, conflicts and peace keeping actions, not so much full on national level warfare.  


Lastly... Ukraine will send them back... and they will be repaired by KMW, Rheinmetal, and any other company involved, and then they will be loaded on to trains... and sent right back to Ukraine to slap the shit out of Russian's who illegally invaded a nation... because KMW and Rheinmetal have made it very clear... stop Russia and their unnecessary aggression, and are building new guns for Ukraine as we speak... hell they are even making RCH18 guns... the newest most advanced guns Germany has, so yes, send the guns back, get them repaired and send them back to the front... because that's what Germany is going to do, because they are the good guys here, just didn't plan for a war like this, which isn't their fault, or saying anything bad about Germany at all, they had a different mindset that looked more towards peace... not towards war, I applaud that.

Heat for cooking, water sterilization, and warmth is the number 1 priority and fire is the answer to that. Batteries and generators will be shipped in as well in greater and greater supply, and installations will get more and more elaborate.

Europe, living under the US nuclear umbrella, is living in a state of artificially-provided security in a way that has never existed before. There has never been a superpower with such strength that can protect a group of 30 countries at 1/12th the world's population that that group of countries doesn't even have to worry so much about security and can spend money on different things. Throughout the history of nation-states with borders, the costs for providing security to your nation were astronomical. Most of the male population would have seen combat in one form or another. 

Due to NATO and the US nuclear umbrella and security guarantees, Europe was able to stop the trend towards constant suspicion towards neighbors and start working with each other for once. One form was the ECSC which eventually turned into the European Union. And somehow it has escaped hundreds of millions of Europeans that this entire peace project of the EU is all based on NATO and is to an extent ""artificial"" or ""not real."" Even though they realized this, they started to make arguments for why ""realism"" or ""neo-realism"" or ""Realpolitik"" were inaccurate and developed theories like Constructivism which says that ""security is a social construct."" One convenient advantages to such lenses through which to see the world is Europe suddenly has billions and billions of dollars that they can now spend on things like healthcare instead of on military spending. 

And it works until it doesn't. 

[This](https://www.ted.com/talks/peter_van_uhm_why_i_chose_a_gun?language=en) Ted Talk (Peter van Uhm) is a great example of sectors of European society that have been working to shake this false belief in the notion of ""Constructivism"" and to remind folks of the grave importance of providing for your own security. 

Anyway, all else being equal, can Europe *really* be sure they will be able to trust that the USA will come to save the day forever? Trump is an example of how the winds can shift. When will Trump 2.0 be elected? I wouldn't say never.

Nagy sought and received assurances, which proved to be false, from Soviet Ambassador Yuri Andropov that the Soviet Union would not invade. The Cabinet, with János Kádár in agreement, declared Hungary's neutrality, withdrew from the Warsaw Pact and requested assistance from the diplomatic corps in Budapest and Dag Hammarskjöld, UN Secretary-General, to defend Hungary's neutrality. Andropov was asked to inform his government that Hungary would begin negotiations on the removal of Soviet forces immediately.

Allowing the Russians to maintain the fantasy that it's just fine to keep hitting civilian infrastructure deep in Western Ukraine or along the Polish border, because reasons and ""special Russia"" and ""we have nukes"" is a very bad idea and not at all how NATO or the United States responded to Soviet provocation throughout the cold war. Not at all. 

It is obviously true that the only reason the Russians are launching wave after wave of missiles deep into Ukraine is the certainty of no reprisals. If the Ukrainians had the capacity to respond with direct strikes on the Black Sea fleet, or staging areas for the Russian missile strikes, this wouldn't be happening. If the US declared that this capability would be provided it would stop.

Ukraine is not the US and also not a NATO member, we can provide whatever weapons we want to them without directly attacking Russia. Are we suddenly in a hot war with Iran because they have equipped Russia with missiles and drones? No, that would be silly. This works both ways, just as it did in the cold war.

Of course the Russians would threaten a Nuclear response, but they would not mean it. They don't actually want to die. 

They also don't want to have their failures in Ukraine spill over into their own Federation and result in the balkanization of the former Russian Federation. 

At the moment their calculation is that attacking Ukraine's power grid is not very risky. It's time to convince them otherwise. It could be done with policy declarations and speeches and it could be done intelligently. 

The stupid, risky move was invading Ukraine in the first place and believing their own propaganda. Now that they have started a ware on their border, it's insane to demand that Ukraine not retaliate within Russia. No nation suporting Ukraine would allow itself to be attacked and limit its response in this way. Ukrainian special ops have already taken place around Belgorod and in various places that Russia considers within Russia (e.g. Crimea and now all the other occupied parts of Ukraine.)

The shameful, wrong and stupid move would be to insist that Ukraine just has to take it and we'll provide them with enough to slow and gradually erode Russian power and slowly, slowly push back while millions are left in the dark an cold and civilians in their apartments far, far from the front keep getting blown to hell by Russian missiles. 

It's not an escalation to all out war with Russia to take the position that the sustained attack on the power grid is not acceptable and will now result in painful and destructive consequences if it doesn't stop.

In case anyone has forgotten how hard the edge of the cold war got...

There is definitely a small but significant chance that it could happen eventually. As you probably know, reducing NATO conventional arms would raise that risk by some uncertain amount.

This isn’t a game and these strikes are continuing. We will be watching Ukraine attack targets on territory that Russia has already claimed as part of Russia.  We already are.

As US and NATO supplied ordinance Raina down on Russia every day we pretend it isn’t happening or would be different if the targets were in “real Russia” instead of occupied Ukraine. 

There is no reason at all why a punitive response to these attacks would have to be a massive strike on Russia indistinguishable from the start of a nuclear strike or launched from NATO or the US. Ukrainian forces could target Russian military facilities in a way that severely hampers attempts to resupply Russian forces in Ukraine or destroys Russian offensive strike capability."

Those who can afford to should consider leaving Ukraine for the winter amid critical energy shortages, according to the head of Ukraine's biggest private energy company.  
Maksym Tymchenko, head of DTEK, told the BBC that if those who were able to left, it would reduce the burden on the energy system for those remaining.   
President Volodymyr Zelensky warned last night that nearly half of the country's energy system is currently disabled following a wave of Russian strikes.  
""The situation is getting worse,"" Tymchenko said. ""Unfortunately, after each attack we have less and less reliable and stable energy system. That's reality.""

NATO exists because Russia is a threat, and I would assume that in a counter-factual scenario of Russia crossing into the Balkans - they have planes too. So what's on the ground if not artillery? Tanks as far as the eye can see? What about HIMARS systems? Surely they would be part of a NATO doctrine, yet why did Germany only order 1200 rockets? If Germany and others had been spending 2% GDP on military, what would these countries have been buying this whole time in line with NATO doctrine? Just planes and tanks? No artillery? What even is NATO doctrine?

There are a handful of NATO doctrinal documents such as Allied Joint Doctrine for Land Operations, Allied Land Tactics, and Command and Control of Allied Land Forces, but they vary too much to be codified and standardized into a single doctrine.

When you say ""There simply wasnt a forseen scenario of heavy-duty artillery wars grinding for months"".. but isn't that how Russia fights wars? This would have been too dangerous for russians to do because we'd just immediately bomb their artillery from the sky? I'm just trying to figure out what you mean when you are justifying the fact that Germany has no spare parts for the PzH2000 because NATO's doctrine didn't call for them. I ask because I assume it wasn't a question of NATO doctrine as much as it was very convenient for Merkel to not buy these systems and spend that money in ways that made her a more popular politician."

When you run out of those parts, you cannibalize other working machinery for parts, happens all the time where logistics aren't easy, like war. That way you can keep at least one vehicle still running, instead of none. It's the entire reason we're not sending over tons of Abrams and such. Keeping 50x different vehicles from different nations working on different standards isn't easy (especially with difference in fluids, fuel, electronics, tools, etc), so to simplify it they focus on things Ukraine already uses or is trained with, while trickling in new technology as much as they can while keeping logistics, politics and training in mind. Sometimes, logistics and such can't keep up, it happens."

China must have one of the worst strategic positions in history - probably the most food and energy insecure nation worldwide, certainly relative to it's huge population. A house of cards at the best of times.

China would have to expand - immediately - to acquire the food and energy resources necessary just to prevent the largest famine in history. Hundreds of millions would die within months otherwise. 
And they have no allies, but plenty of wary neighbours.

Their economy is heavily export dependent/integrated with the global economy, so any aggressive/expansionist action leaves them incalculably more exposed to sanction than what we've seen with Russia.

Their only real option would be to grab large chunks of Russia immediately, but Russia, or whatever remains if the Federation collapses, would almost certainly resort to nukes.
Same for India, which presumably could start a chain reaction with Pakistan.
Japan will be nuclear armed within a weekend if threatened.

China is quite dichotomous, very densely populated cities and empty underdeveloped rural areas, leaving them very vulnerable.

China might be able to win a few battles, especially with inferior opponents, but it's very difficult to see how China could sustain anything other than an extremely short war without extremely dramatic consequences."

And really, their ongoing efforts to hurt the US/UK well before this war is a giant reason these countries are pushing so hard to help Ukraine fight back.  In fact, if Russia hadn't been such a constant antagonist, I reckon these countries wouldn't have nearly so many people that are openly and widely supportive of aiding Ukraine extensively.

In effect, Russia's antagonism of the US and UK prior to this war even starting is a big reason why they're losing right now.

If it wasn't for the military training of 35,000 Ukrainian troops since 2014 provided by UK & Canada, along with all the NLAWs and Javelins at the outset of this current invasion, Ukraine would probably have lost very quickly.

To say the west has contributed almost nothing is totally incorrect.

The reason we don't have healthcare, though, is all that money we're spending goes not for healthcare, but a large part is siphoned off by health insurance providers for CEO bonuses and shareholder dividends. 

As long as whatever entity is providing health coverage has profit as a motivating factor instead of medical care as its obligation we'll always have this problem.

Republicans say the government shouldn't run healthcare b/c it'll be defrauded and inefficient of something. But I'd rather a handful of underpaid slightly corrupt local government employees pocket a little bit of change than to continue getting robbed in broad daylight by the health insurance industries with the money going to already rich millionaires and billionaires. 

And as for the efficiency part, show me one person who says their current healthcare plan is easy to understand and fast and easy to deal with and isn't a headache of waiting on the phone and denial of coverage."

As Russian troops flooded into Belarus leading up to the full scale invasion, the Belarusian people were put in a hard position in that any acts of resistance led to brutality against them and it only strengthened Lukashenka’s grip on the country. 

I’d argue that Putin silently “took” Belarus the moment troops started moving in for “training”. Not to mention the fact that Lukashenka has agreed to permanently house Russian troops in Belarus and establish bases indefinitely. I very much hope to see democracy flourish in Belarus and Russian soldiers expelled. There’s been a number of documented incidents where Russian soldiers have assaulted or harassed Belarusian citizens.

I very much hope that Stoltenberg’s plan to created a layered defense system for Ukraine comes to fruition so this Russian “strategy” falls short. 

Still, knowing that Russian missile stockpile numbers are much lower than Russia would have anticipated at this point in the conflict, it’s hard not to wonder what they’ll do when those numbers reach a very critical level. They cannot produce missiles en masse, lack necessary technology for manufacturing, and already have a capped production capacity for things like the Kalibr missile. It’s been reported that the Iskander supply is very low, which is both good and bad simultaneously. 

As much as I want Russia’s quiver to run dry, I worry that once they’ve expended all their non-nuclear options it’ll leave only one choice for them.  Still, Russia over expends their missile resources and cannot match production to keep pace. This is why Putin has his busking bowl out to Iran, as without that military aid he’ll have busted at the table.

 On Saturday afternoon, November 19, there was a powerful explosion at a gas filling station near the village of Berngardovka, in the Leningrad Region.

 Local residents report that as a result of the detonation, ""walls and windows trembled"" in their homes. The blast wave was felt even by the village of Mulino, located a few kilometers from the scene. 

The first details and footage are available on the Ukraine 365 Telegram channel . The fire occurred on the gas pipeline between Berngardovka and Kovalevo. The causes of the incident are not known yet.

About Nato: I think some competition between designs is useful and necessary for development. What you described was the concept of cold war Nato, where everyone played their role to a certain degree (Germany preparing for highly mobile outnumbered tank defense warfare against a red wave - and conventional submarines, utilizing its huge experience from WW2). But somehow most European armies left that path but did not develop any consequence in their new layouts. What is the German army supposed to be? One highly specialiced wheel in the Nato machine? An army which has every necessary capability of fighting asymetric wars or smaller conflicts? Or go the overly expensive US way and create a defence force which can deter any threat on their own, which, in my eyes, would include nuclear deterrence in some form?

First down to Melitopol to avoid needing to cross the Dneipro and push to the coast - cutting land supply to Crimea.  This will of course be a tough battle.

Then you have fire control over the Kerch bridge and the sea lanes with Neptune missiles.  This essentially cutting of resupply to the whole of Crimea.

Then you just apply constant pressure to use up what ammo and supplies left, until they can’t put up a fight anymore.

Just like they took Kherson without a massive battle and casualties.  Easy - no.  But I don’t see how Russia will be able to prevent it if Ukraine continue to be smart about their engagements."

My whole point is that first, Ukraine needs to put Russia in a position where negotiations would be preferable to continuing the fight, i.e. recapture all territory, and make it unfeasible for Russia to engage in offensives. Then you can convene a peace treaty.

And yes, I do believe from that position, you can make certain concessions that Russia would accept, but would secure Ukraine's territorial integrity for the long term. If Ukraine pushed out Russia from its territory, and accepted a two-way guarantee between East and West (basically an *actually enforceable* Budapest Memorandum), like what Austria got in 1955, that would secure that Ukraine could stay independent and neutral."

There are  many factors that combined to make him as immovable as he is, he governed in a time when insane amounts of EU funding came in every year and got spent, in a wholly unsupervised manner, by his appointees. It’s hard to win an election against an incumbent when times are good, and with that much money flowing in, times will be good. It’s even harder to win when the incumbent buys out and manually controls most media, when they rewrite the election laws, the constitution, and have handpicked appointees in every office that should provide oversight. 

One example: the richest man in Hungary at the moment is someone who, before 2010, was a simple gas repairperson who happened to have been Orban’s childhood friend. He has done nothing of note, invented nothing, he is a wholly unremarkable dumbfuck who is now worth over a billion EUR.

The German car industry and the EU leadership have subsidized all this. It boggled my mind that it took until 2021 (!!) for FIDESZ to be thrown out of the EPP. Eleven fucking years. The constitution rewrite, election system rewrite, all that, was year 2-3 in this process. Orban Viktor’s son-in-law had a company using EU funds to install LED lighting all over Hungary well before year 8. (This last one ended up being so indefensible that Hungary just opted out of the funding post fact, the clearest admission of guilt you could have) 

I understand peoples ire with my country, all I can say is : some of us don’t want this, and propaganda is a hell of a drug. 12 years of brainwashing is a crazy amount. Think about it, the nazis came to power in 1933. By 1939, they started WWII. 6 years. By 1941, the Holocaust had begun. That’s 8 years. This has been 12."

Actually, they did.  There were several arms limitation treaties signed to reduce nuclear weapons that involved the of removal of systems, such as the INF treaty.

A year ago, there was a large surplus of Russian or Soviet compatible weapons, munitions, and systems in the world that China could turn towards to provide short term supply and replacements.  There was also a Russian defense industry that (allegedly) could ramp up production to supply buyers.

Both of those are gone.

Plus, you have to understand that this is a huge wake up call to China. Most of their “high end” weapons are just cheap copies of Russian systems, and we’re seeing how poorly those Russian systems perform. On top of that, China hasn’t had any combat experience since they invaded Vietnam after we left, Russia has lots of experience in the past 25 years (Chechnya, Georgia, Syria, Ukraine). This means that Chinese generals know that their equipment is garbage (all those flat tires on Russian vehicles in the beginning of the war were Chinese made military grade tires) and they have zero confidence in how their soldiers will perform in combat.

China is just as much of a paper tiger as Russia, and China can’t even afford to lose a ton of troops because they’re looking at the same population problems that Russia is (but worse because the “one child” generation is now working to support a huge aging generation and a huge generation of kids after one-child was ended).

The only real reputable source I could find from the first page was from Radio Free Liberty which according to Wiki is US based, and that ""Radio Free Europe is often seen as an outlet for American propaganda and US interests more generally"". Their only source is an Ukrainian webpage. They also end the article with ""Due to the ongoing conflict in Kherson, RFE/RL could not immediately confirm Khlan’s claims."" so.

The story seems plausible and I don't doubt some people in the intelligence community saw the outcome of the war earlier on, leading to stuff like selling assets and preparing to leave Russia, but it's hardly ""all over the internet"".

It also is nowhere close to ""too many sources on Google to search""; most hits lead directly to Twitter, which is just repeating the same story without any point of origin. u/VaccinatedVariant

I did find a Business Insider article about one Russian official purchasing an apartment in Kyiv before the war started, but that's just a story about one guy. In addition, this guy didn't buy an apartment aboard because he believed the war would fail, but that they would win so fast and he wanted to own property in Ukraine after it all was done so he could move in there. Which is the opposite of Russian officials already knowing Russia would lose; that's a Russian official thinking Russia would win.

u/lukeworldwalker where can I find ""the OSINT guys"" write-up? It would definitely be good to have access to such a source directly.

It's dangerous, even for this subreddit, when truth is no longer confirmed and only repeated, especially when said in such a careless manner as ""it's known by everyone"" when in fact it might not have any ties to reality.

It's the same issue of using lower altitude hypersonics to kill anything that isn't stationary - you have limited ways to communicate with it once it processes a plasma sheath and likewise it can't emit, and a separate issue for a ballistic weapon is it has limited flight surfaces to actually go that far in a terminal decelerated phase where it can communicate again (most MIRV warhead for example are going to start their small creep to their target while literally in space - even though yes they are moving a lot faster and a lot higher than what is for all intents and purposes short range ballistic missiles).

Separately, even if you can get mid-course comms to it when it's in the upper atmosphere and slower with less interference from less atmosphere being heated, you need immensely accurate ISR data fused in real time and relayed which would be a huge challenge for the US with our wall of dedicated systems let alone anyone else.

Finally, hitting anything as relatively small as even a carrier moving with a ballistic weapon is really, really hard. Good real world CEPs are about the width of a flight deck, and that assumes the flight deck is perfectly still.

So yes, something to be aware of, but really it's more Chinese A2/AD just like their S-400 knock off batteries all over the Spratleys. Sure they're designed to actually mission kill something, but really their huge range, while threatening to challenge, is more just to keep pushing you away, just like how an S-400 engaging at the edge of range isn't going to kill anything aware that it's being launched at, but you'll keep running away from it, aren't going to get close enough to launch an ARM at it (yet - we're working on that), and are less likely to, without having your initial combat posture, push further in towards it where its p(k) gets higher but also it can now distract you and kill your energy which makes you more vulnerable to other systems.

A CVBG under routine ASBM harassment isn't launching flight ops, probably stops emitting if it has other assets near by that can (since it's not going to shoot down an ASBM in all realism), and isn't getting closer to the Chinese mainland where super-sonic anti-ship missiles from multiple vectors actually could overwhelm and kill a whole CVBG distracted by China's ASBM vaporware vollies.

And in that regard, the system works. China pumps up a lot of vaporware in its press just like the Russians. But I will give them credit as, despite the bullshit that hits their papers, they do seem to have very credible integrated plan for all of these systems that are all about making the opportunity cost for US involvement in an invasion of Taiwan or further annexation in the South China Sea too high to pursue, or would stall and blunt a response enough to allow them to finish their operation to establish a new status quo to negotiate from in the event of a longer war. It's smarter and a quietly a lot more self aware than the bullshit that the Ruskis spee on a day to day basis."

> “The horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act a part, but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid joining in. Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary. A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current, turning one even against one's will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic. And yet the rage that one felt was an abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp.”"

You can never totally defeat a nuclear powered country.  

Russia's war aims have likely changed since February as well.  I think them securing any of the annexed territories will be viewed as a victory on their part, even if it's short of what they originally wanted, which was either total annexation Ukraine, or at least a regime change to install a Russian puppet government to have effective control of the country. 

>What makes you think that their poorly trained mobiks with some Iranian body armour and some additional missiles will fare better?

Commercial air travel is disappearing as they have to harvest their planes for parts to keep others operational. 

To give you an idea of where this is heading - North Korea's main (and only) airline only has ~20 working planes. I don't think Russia will get *that* bad, but they will be stuck with 1970s technology for the next half century if they don't give in to some serious concessions."

 >Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) rockets have an extended range and add GPS-aided guidance to their Inertial Navigation System. Flight control is accomplished by four forward-mounted canards driven by electromechanical actuators. GMLRS rockets were introduced in 2005 and can be fired from the M270A1 and M270A2, the European M270A1 variants (British Army M270B1, German Army MARS II, French Army Lance Roquette Unitaire (LRU), Italian Army MLRS Improved (MLRS-I), Finnish Army M270D1), and the lighter M142. M30 and M31 rockets are, except for their warheads, identical.

Former Prime Minister of Great Britain Boris Johnson is convinced that under the current circumstances Ukraine has nothing to negotiate with Russia.  
  
He wrote about this in a column for the Wall Street Journal , Censor.NET reports with reference to Ukrinform .  
  
""I understand why Volodymyr Zelenskyi says that he is ready for negotiations with Putin, and I do not doubt the sincerity of the Ukrainian president. If there was even an adequate peace plan available, the Ukrainian government would quickly seize it,"" Johnson said.  
  
According to him, Ukraine definitely wants peace.  
  
""Of course, Ukraine would like negotiations. But there is one problem, and it is the same one that Zelenskyi faces every day since February 24 - there is nothing to agree on. No potential mediator has yet been able to come up with a compromise that would be even slightly acceptable."" - said the former British Prime Minister.  
  
In his opinion, if we even assume that Western leaders would succeed in convincing Ukraine to ""exchange land for peace"", ""any agreement of this kind will be disgusting and a moral disgrace for humanity.""  
  
""Even if the Ukrainians can be convinced to give up their rights to part of their lands, although they must not, cannot and will not do this, there is no reason to believe that Putin will abide by the terms of the agreement. Putin does not want to receive part of Ukraine. He wants all of her,"" Johnson emphasized.

The ''Flaw'' is he fell into the ''Dictator trap'' of living in a echo chamber of his own thoughts, having killed anyone that put forth a realistic assessment of current events and situations.

His refusal to realistically see where this war is going is a reflection on the self image of a dictator, whom by very nature is never wrong in his own eye's.

If he looked a little further down the time line, the Western Powers are giving him a chance to stop by ramping up the weapon supply to Ukraine. It's a carrot and stick situation where you take the carrot or get hit with the stick.

The Ukrainian Armed Forces will be a well equipped mechanized army fighting a ''Modern Mechanized'' style of combat. If Putin does not withdraw the weapons flow will only increase from the West until there is a 1 million man army in Ukraine right on his border ready to take revenge for Russian war crimes.

He is caught with his army depleted and his source of conscripts empty and his weapons proved to be sub-par.

Then his only card is nuclear, which the people around him will not comply with as they know this means extinction.

He gambled his view of the world was accurate, but with no credible feedback, he has overplayed his cards. He is a broke gambler who refuses to leave the table."

Sure, NATO is training troops in the UK (roughly 2500 per month, so 40 months to replace the current losses) but fresh troops aren’t worth half as much as experienced troops. Ukraine is winning, but they have to do it a little at a time otherwise they’ll need to pull troops from one front to support another (which is the exact strategy russia has been using with abysmal results). 

And while NATO has supplied a ton of weapons, it’s a drop in the bucket compared to what’s needed. 30 HIMARS across a 1,000 mile front isn’t enough to beat back the Russians. Ukraine is also still losing their attack aircraft at a steady pace, and the west hasn’t sent much to replace these losses. If you can’t control the sky and if you can’t absolutely obliterate the enemy behind their lines, you’re going to have to fight for every single kilometer and pay for it all in blood.

A nuclear power didn't surrender, it *pulled out*. This is a crucial difference. The US wasn't at war with Afghanistan, it was fighting an insurgency. This is not applicable to the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, because the two countries are at war with one another. 

From the perspective of Russia, Ukraine is currently occupying Russian territory. From the perspective of Ukraine, Russia is occupying Ukrainian territory. This war won't be over until this is settled in a peace deal. 

I find it funny how people are saying that Ukraine should not agree to any sort of ceasefire or peace deal because that would only give Russia time to re-arm and try again at a later date, but at the same time demanding that Russia be put into a position where they cannot feasibly make another attempt. The two demands are mutually exclusive: either you come up with a peace deal that provides guarantees for Ukraine that it won't be invaded again, or Russia will invade again on the future. If Ukraine just beats the Russian forces out of Ukrainian territory, Russia will just re-arm and try again in a couple years' time, but this time with a better army that will have learned the lessons of this war. 

You also cannot talk about any sort of EU or NATO ascension until you have a settled peace deal, which, once again, will just allow Russia to attempt another invasion at a later date. 

>Russia using nukes because they lost a war would make them a pariah even in the eyes of brutal regimes like China.

Those two scenarios are extremely far apart from each other in terms of severity. 

Also, you forget that a third party arresting a Russian diplomat on grounds connected to the war is an active involvement in the war. I personally find it weird how the west and Iran etc. Are not already considered active war parties (for training and supplying the fighting nations), but that's just how the country leaders see it at the moment - it is what it is.

And no, diplomats as political prisoners doesn't really happen (or at least I don't hear about it).

Yes, Russia breaks every single agreement, but doing so ourselves puts us at a disadvantage and reaffirms the views of the brainwashed pro-russian population everywhere in the world. Too many people in the world are just straight up brain-dead at the moment, believing the Russian lies fully.

1668879388.0,iwzw0ro,t5_30hhs,0,2,offogredux,0,"While Ukraine is finding modern missile based defenses useful, this should be useful too. Consider two points: Ukraine is big, and the infrastructure can be hit and harmed at a thousand nodes spread throughout the country. And most Russian missiles and drones can be taken down by just about anything, if the attack can be tracked by an AD radar and the munition comes within range. IRIS and NASAMS ,ect. are most effective, but quantity is very limited. But when a drone or crise missile flies over a Gepard, the probability of interception is nearly the same- only the range is smaller. 

Ukraine needs quantity maybe more than quality, to cover all those nodes, be they old HAWK systems, Avengers firing stingers- or AA guns guided by radar and firing proximity fused shells."

In this case, getting westerners to think that 75% of Crimeans really did vote for a Russian takeover would be a solid win for not very much effort. The number is completely made up of course with no evidence supplied whatsoever."

Partly poking at the whole idea of Maidan 2014 being a CIA-orchestrated coup.  Partly just dumb fun to cheer people up in all the gloom.

&#x200B;

Then people started making avatars out of these ""fellas"" — and a funny social phenomenon happened.  They realized ""hey wait a minute there are so many of us.""  And there's strength in numbers.  They started shouting down pro-russian propaganda on places like twitter, and/or exposing botnets where tons of accounts say something that seems like a human-made comment until you discover dozens of other accounts have literally said the exact same thing, word-for-word.  Basically un-""gaslighting"" people.

Then they realized there were enough of them to start hosting online fundraisers for Ukraine.   They started with little things like armor and night-vision optics.   Eventually, absurdly, they've moved onto ... well, a howitzer.  At least one Bayraktar, iirc, etc.

He agreed to pull US forces out of afghanistan on condition that (1) they didn't attack western forces and (2) they engaged with afghan gov on a peace deal.  While they did the former part of that, the latter part of deal was not only not honored, but they infiltrated areas as US forces pulled back, did all sorts of attacks on govt forces & assassinated lots of govt admin officials.  Trump kept up with the 'withdrawal' despite his conditions not being met, but that's totally not a surrender.  Okay, so russia should do an withdrawal where ukraine doesn't attack the retreating forces and there are no other conditions Ukraine has to  honor...

Who cares what the perspective of russia is on the sovereignty of ukraine?  That's the point here, they don't get to dictate the sovereignty of 50 million people because they think they should be subservient to Russia.  Ukraine was a distinct republic within USSR just like Russia was.  Its territory was recognized under the USSR constitution, as was its right as a state in its own right (e.g., it was founding member of the UN).  The dissolution of USSR, Ukraine was as much an independent state as Russia was, and this was effected with the consent of all involved.  Not only that, Russia agreed to secruity assurances and to respect Ukraine's territorial integrity & independence in an explicit treaty.  To say that Russia views some or all of Ukraine as its own territory speaks to how pointless it would be for Ukraine to negotiate anything with Russia other than its complete withdrawal from Ukrainian territory.

You're missing the point.  If Ukraine doesn't hold substantially all of its territory at the end of this, it will be forced to either concede that in perpetuity, or will be significantly impeded from making defensive alliances.  Russia can re-arm as much as it wants if Ukraine gets all of its land back, because Ukraine will then be able to enter defensive treaties with western allies.  And no, Ukraine doesn't need a peace deal with Russia to do these, it just needs to be able to credibly assure allies that it won't engage in any aggression against russian territory.  so long as russia occupies ukrainian territory, those types of assurances may not be credible.

If nuclear weapons were as simple as destroy the entire world or not use them, there would be no discussion or threat about their use here.  Using tactical nukes would be decisive against Ukraine in the current war, unless Nato would be willing to enter the war.  If Russia thereafter used tactical nukes on Nato forces, then you're in the realm of nuclear escalation.  But imho there is little reason to fear that, because using a nuke would not meet any of Russia's aims.  It is hard to imagine a more cowardly act and of course even China wouldn't stand for it, nor would India continue to engage with Russia.  Putin and his cronies haven't stolen billions from russians in order to become north korea part deux."

That might be part of his plan, but I think the actual plan is to terrorize Ukraine into submission while winter bears down on the country - try to force Zelenskyy to accept his demands.

Remember, we heard yesterday (or the day before) that the Russian political elite thinks this will end with Zelenskyy resigning his post. This is likely part of the plan - terrorize the Ukrainian people until Zelenskyy has no choice but to step aside and a Kremlin-friendly puppet is installed.

Out of everything Russia is doing right now, that's the only thing that remotely makes sense. They know they can't win on the ground, and all signs point to Putin trying to get some kind of temporary truce to get off their back feet (which Ukraine has outright rejected)."

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/09/us/politics/russia-ukraine-james-baker.html

While there was indeed discussion between Mr. Baker and the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the months after the fall of the Berlin Wall about limiting NATO jurisdiction if East and West Germany were reunited, no such provision was included in the final treaty signed by the Americans, Europeans and Russians.

“The bottom line is, that’s a ridiculous argument,” Mr. Baker said in an interview in 2014, a few months after Russia seized Crimea and intervened in eastern Ukraine. “It is true that in the initial stages of negotiations I said ‘what if’ and then Gorbachev himself supported a solution that extended the border that included the German Democratic Republic,” or East Germany, within NATO. Since the Russians signed that treaty, he asked, how can they rely “on something I said a month or so before? It just doesn’t make sense.”

https://hls.harvard.edu/today/there-was-no-promise-not-to-enlarge-nato/

Zoellick vividly recalls the White House meeting he attended nearly three decades ago in which Bush asked Gorbachev if he agreed with the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe principle that nations are free to ally with others as they see fit. When Gorbachev said yes, he says, the Soviet leader’s “own colleagues at the table visibly separated themselves.”"

I just wanted to point out that the underlying problem is far deeper than simple underfunding: The bureaucracy of a democracy which makes it terribly complicated.

You got a Procurement Office which cannot directly order spare parts, because the ministry first has to give its ok (attempt to prevent lobbyism). But what happens if the ministry just doesn't say anything to this? If they don't accept or deny? 

I mean there must be a systematic problem in planning.  How is it possible to delay a decision such a long time? An instruction has been missing cuz it was possible. It seems that setting ultimate deadlines, which is standard in business, could have prevented this planning error.

Edit: that's why i say the gov is stoopid. They are just unable to handle a standard planning process."

The outcome of the war in Ukraine will be one of the factors determining the security situation in the world in the 21st century.  
  
As Censor.NET informs, this was reported by RBC-Ukraine with reference to the statement of US Defense Minister Lloyd Austin during the International Security Forum in Halifax.  
  
""The results of the war in Ukraine will help determine the course of global security in this century,"" he said.  
  
Austin also claimed that NATO is a defensive alliance and does not seek confrontation with Russia, does not pose a threat to it.  
  
""But we will not be drawn into the war. We will support Ukraine,"" said the head of the Pentagon.  
  
Austin added that the US will defend every inch of NATO territory and continue to strengthen the alliance's collective defenses.

With a Statement like that its clear the US/NATO is fully backing a UA win, without giving either putin or xi the opportunity to blame NATO as both like to. the downside to this is that to ensure Non participation the escalation of weapon supplies has to be proportional, which leads to lives lost for UA, in my view  borderline immoral, but from a geo-political view which those leaders are forced to be led by understandable."

Thus, in order to load the next shell, these systems have to move the drum or belt and thus they move **all** available shells. At the same time.

Moving 60x50kg is an enormous stress on motors and bearings and they fail often. Manual override is extremely slow.

While the PzH-2000 only moves one 50kg shell and that is a common in task factory manufacturing. And in case of failure, manaul override is also much faster.

So what looks fragile and error prone to you could easily be even more robust due to lower weight moved and  industry proven parts instead of custom made special parts (which Industry moves 3000kg on a belt?).

And also - what I heard common artillery needs a barrel change every 3000 shots. And the PzH-2000 shoots on average 300 shots a day.

This is a very good point, and I agree on the weirdness of involvement, but (not to deflect entirely) that also is more fundamental to my overall 'argument' over the entire conflict.  Precedent is either undefined or just completely arbitrary.

The idea that this very open proxy war is truly any different than direct NATO involvement is baffling.  Poland (and the rest of NATO+) is already involved, Iran is certainly involved, perhaps directly, and all the proxying is doing is getting more people killed by making the conflict drag on longer, because there's no middle ground end-game.  Russia couldn't dream of holding ground against NATO proper, so either Russia eventually withdraws, or it resorts to the only real weapons it has and we end up in nuclear war.

As for pro-russia people, I certainly don't care about placating them as they aren't worth consideration in any international diplomacy, and I honestly think you're overestimating their numbers.  Plus, the more they talk, the easier they are to find and investigate for treason.  If they're just willfully ignorant or victims of propaganda, that's a social issue to be dealt with in other ways.

See you can have free trade with a country that adheres to the same rules and principles, China isn't a country like that.

So for me complete protectionism of critical infrastructure and industries and layered protectionism depending per country is a wise move forwards, even the playing field for domestic companies by enforcing huge tariffs on Chinese crap, I mean, Italy used to be the cheap crap vendor of Europe until the Chinese undercut their industry, there is no reason why another European country couldn't be the Cheap crap manufacturer again, keeping industry within the confines of the continent will allow poorer countries to flourish and grow more swiftly."

You seem to lack an understanding of democracy. You see, democracy only works when both sides operate in good faith. As you note, doing ""what they believe is best for the country"". Except that's not what Republicans do at all. Their platform has no positive project, no policy or plan that would actually constitute doing what's best for the country. Their platform is to destroy anything Democrats do good or bad, deregulate industries (which is guaranteed to be disastrous), regulate personal lives (so much for freedom), and end democratic egalitarianism.

You're protecting Republicans under a system they actively oppose and seek to destroy. If they want to act in good faith, they're welcome to change their platform. As it stands, they're Christofascists who offer little else than authoritarian bluster. 

Why are you defending the GOP under the banner of democracy, when their platform is anti-democracy? Why worry about their free speech when they do not support free speech?"

I don't know if he was shooting the surrendering soldiers (there's been lots of reports of this, right?) or the Ukrainians.

I don't know if it turned into a protracted firefight and he leapt behind his comrades for cover (if he cared about their safety he wouldn't have launched his suicide attack right next to them).

I don't know if the Ukrainians killed him and then executed each and every one of his comrades in cold blood.

What was once the most important exchange forum between German and Russian civil society, the Petersburg Dialogue, will apparently be dissolved for good.

""At the request of the board of directors, the general meeting of the Petersburg Dialogue decides to hold another extraordinary general meeting in the 1st quarter of 2023, in which the dissolution of the Petersburg Dialogue is to be decided,"" reads a letter obtained by SPIEGEL. The dissolution was decided at a meeting on Friday and is to be brought to the General Assembly on Nov. 22.

Vladimir Putin and Gerhard Schröder had founded the association in 2000 to promote exchange between civil society and the media on the German and Russian sides. Once a year, journalists, diplomats, scientists, artists, business representatives and politicians from different parties meet in Germany or Russia - the last time was about three years ago in Bonn. Since Nawalny's poisoning and the Ukraine war, the event was no longer held and the forum increasingly developed into a soliloquy.

The Petersburg Dialogue was funded by foundations, the business community and the German Foreign Office, but became increasingly less important as German-Russian relations deteriorated. From 2015 until the end, the head of the forum was Merkel's former chancellor's office chief Roland Pofalla (CDU). According to SPIEGEL information, several members of the Petersburg Dialogue had already signaled that they would no longer be available before the now threatened dissolution."

1668887929.0,ix0g52h,t5_30hhs,0,1,rd1970,0,"It wouldn't take much to tear society down and cause chaos. 

No electricity or internet means no credit or debit cards. This quickly causes a run on the banks as people scramble to take out as much cash as they can. It also means no refrigeration - which in turn means food supply issues. 

No running water means no flushing toilets. Within days you'll have raw sewage running down every street. That eventually leads to hygiene issues and diseases like dysentery. 

Most people will only be getting their news from radio at this point - until you take that away. 

Then you start the psychological warfare. Leave notices on people's doors telling them ""Alert: Sniper in your area. A sniper or snipers are responsible for the deaths of several drivers and pedestrians in your area. Do not leave your home under any circumstances. Some reports indicate they are dressed as police officers and may have access to a police vehicle. Lock all doors and windows immediately. Close all blinds and curtains. Do not use candles or other source of light after dark. If someone approaches your home do not open or stand near the door. If you must leave for an emergency drive at the maximum speed possible. Do not stop for traffic lights or signs. Drive in a zigzag pattern at all times."".

The ensuing chaos would be hilarious."

Also, there are good reasons jets haven't been sent yet. I think they should be, but I doubt they will at this point in time. What I'm saying is that it is silly to think this will cripple Ukraine because it won't. They are not so weak that this is the last straw and they will be crippled from here on out and have to give up. It won't happen and is silly to think it will. Just like it is silly to think that Russia has the capacity to keep launching 100+ missiles a week, they don't have even the capacity to make close to that many new ones and the stocks are getting low. It's also silly to think that the west is just going to let Ukraine sit there without support for the infrastructure. Germany alone has already sent almost 2,500 industrial generators. To think that there is no support coming, or that has been delivered and that all is lost and Ukraine will be permanently crippled is silly. It's not true, and not going to happen. Russia made a move and changed the game in the last month, but Ukraine is responding and already solving these issues. In a month they will have made even more progress and the strike threat will be minimal I'm sure. The next real risk, to be honest, is going to be the Russian pivot from cruise missiles to ballistic missiles when they realize that the cruise missiles are no longer a threat. That will be risky as it will be an obvious escalation, and if they prove to be supplied from Iran, it will trigger a reciprocal escalatory reaction from the west. Probably with ATACMS  but possibly even pushing all the way to Fighter Jets. But to say that Ukraine is crippled right now, or that they will be crippled shortly, is just silly."

Nobody of them is gonna start a war involvement over one citizen, but they might possibly, if it's a government official. See the Poland missile strike, where the polish and US statement of the ""investigation"" is extremely dubious.

Yes, precedent is definitely arbitrary in practical use. The theory is pretty straight forward, but the actual decision in the real world is a whole different topic.

>and all the proxying is doing is getting more people killed by making the conflict drag on longer, because there's no middle ground end-game. Russia couldn't dream of holding ground against NATO proper, so either Russia eventually withdraws, or it resorts to the only real weapons it has and we end up in nuclear war.

And exactly that is the problem and literally the sole and only reason, why NATO hasn't curb-stomped Russia yet. They know, what even a single nuclear missile can cause in terms of damage. Europe still feels the effects of Tschernobyl to this day and that was almost 40 years ago.

>As for pro-russia people, I certainly don't care about placating them as they aren't worth consideration in any international diplomacy, and I honestly think you're overestimating their numbers

Maybe, but their numbers have actually been rising since the start of the war and THAT is concerning. These people are so extremely delusional, that they can truly be called nothing but ""bot"" or ""troll"". They use extremely vile and immoral methods of communication and neither social media companies nor society actually try to silence them. Most people have lost the ability to oppose extremely damaging speech and instead hide behind ""tolerance"". 

Under normal circumstances, every single of the pro-Russia social media accounts should be deleted and those protesters should be charged with treason, just like neo-Nazi protests should be handled, but that never happens. Freedom of speech/freedom to protest is a double-edged sword, just like freedom of the press in their respective current forms. We need those freedoms, but at the same time they take away our means to fight against behavior that is very dangerous to society or even humanity.

And as for international diplomacy. Hungary just now shows how utterly feeble, defenseless, unstable, incompetent and indecisive Western politics are. Hungary keeps pulling EU by the nose, despite being so utterly insignificant in itself. If everything went correctly, Hungary (and most likely even turkey) would've been thrown out of NATO a LOOONG time ago.

Whilst there are others who are suggesting similar things, I never have and that's a strawman. By the time thousands are surrendering that has to be spread out enough in both space and time that there should be some of them either fully captured or still fully unsurrendered and so that one action could really only affect those who were surrendering in the same area at the same time. 

The responsibility of the capturing force for the safety of prisoners begins from when those prisoners are in custody. These prisoners are not. 

The definition of ""hors de combat"" also doesn't yet fully apply to them also because they are part of an apparently surrendering _formation_ where actually, because that formation still has an armed member. However, it's an interesting question of whether they, themselves

So let's do a little analysis of the actors.

* Ukrainian fighters here - set up a reasonable and normal surrender. Did not harm any prisoners until attacked. - Clearly innocent victims. 
* Russians apparently surrendering - complex to tell - we can't be sure whether they knew about the perfidy - others have suggested that they looked back, but that does not show intent directly and is not sufficient evidence to blame them
* Russian who faked surrender and then attacked - a clear war criminal and all acts here fall on him and are a consequence of his perfidy
* Russian leadership - there is clear evidence of them encouraging acts of perfidy. Likely guilty of war crimes
* Me - I have no control of Ukrainians and I encourage following the rules of war and accepting surrenders - innocent
* You - I wonder. Are you perhaps part of or connected to Russia - clearly trying to displace blame for perfidy - if you believe that you have influence over Russian fighters then likely you are a criminal trying to encourage perfidy by displace blame; more likely just misinformed on the internet."

I believe he is responsible for the intentional killing of a large group of non-combatants.

There's a really complicated discussion about negligence. Should the Russians that were surrendering have made sure that he put his weapon away safely so that he couldn't attack the Ukrainians. If they were truly careless then they might also share blame for the Ukrainian who was harmed. I don't think that's likely if we are fair to them.

Fortunately unlike Azovstal, they can get resupplied. The whole eastern front has been a nightmare.

They desperately need more tanks and artillery there but they just don't have it and the West for whatever reason doesn't want to give them more. You would think sending a few artillery pieces wouldn't be such a big deal but I guess I'm missing something. Right now they still say the Ukrainians are outmatched about 20 to 1 on that front.

1668891201.0,ix0ntkn,t5_30hhs,0,1,Helllo_Man,0,"That’s actually kind of the opposite of what’s true about missiles vs planes. Cruise missiles are by nature extremely difficult to acquire and shoot down. They fly incredibly low (often below 1000ft AGL) and while they are slower than a Mach capable fighter, they make course changes in flight and are quite small. 

Those two things together mean that they are difficult to detect from far away. Low cruising altitude means they quickly fall below the radar/visual horizon. Their small size further decreases the ranges at which a significant radar return is generated. 

It turns out that one of the more reliable ways to shoot down cruise missiles is with planes looking at or down on them with air-air missiles. This is obviously challenging though, because 🇺🇦 is a large country, and most target search radars on Ukrainian planes are…aged, especially their MiG 29 fleet. You also have to chase a missile with a plane…which is inconvenient and time consuming. 

If ukraine had a fleet of airborne radars like the American AWACS platform (and could protect them), things might be a little different."

They can use their influence over Iran to gain influence within the Shia militias in Iraq which would then threaten our ability to maintain our stranglehold in vital oil shipping lanes, they can destabilize our operations in Africa, and China may have viewed it as a pretext for handing similar systems to Taiwan. Russia could also sponsor another Serbia-Kosovo war, they could’ve also ratcheted up attacks against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure and they could also use their influence in Syria to push us out of the oil fields we control there which would mean Assad gets a huge financial windfall and could continue to butcher Idlib province (and maybe even try to destabilize Lebanon so that Hezbollah can completely control the government). Hell, Russia could’ve expanded its presence in South America and Cuba.

International events don’t happen in a vacuum, most of it is interconnected and the US supplying those missiles too early on could have resulted in a dramatic escalation. Yes, what they’re doing in Ukraine is abhorrent but they still have the capacity to cause a lot of damage elsewhere; hence why it was important for the US to not rush into handing these weapons to Ukraine (especially before we could trust them to not use them on civilian centers in places like Belgorod)."

It's an expedition. You need equipment and (expired) rations and transport. Those all require manpower (so more equipment, rations, and transport) and guards or the enemy will attack supply chains. An inferior soldier requires almost as much support as a good soldier (maybe worse rations and equipment, but much more supervision). A bad tanks may cost more to field than a good tank.

A mechanic fixing the broken a truck that's transporting conscripts can't fix the T72 that an elite unit is waiting for (after they accidently left their T80 behind).

A real war requires logistics. You don't intentionally send poor troops to the front.

These are largely practical matters. Normally you have to take ""reasonable care"" and avoid ""negligence"". Also normally war is a total mess and people are allowed to keep themselves safe.

If there were hundreds of heavily armed and protected Ukrainian soldiers and small groups of Russians you would expect them to separate the Russians rapidly and make them safe. At that point more than a few being killed would be a serious failure on the Ukrainian side. 

If a huge group of Russians surrendered to one Ukrainian (has happened in WWII near the end where Germans were desperately looking for Western forces to surrender to - e.g. an entire German unit surrendered to a cook who was out walking with just his pistol) then the surrendering group is almost entirely responsible for safety until they get back to the base. They need to ensure that none of their group has a weapon themselves.

In this case we are in an unfortunate and very dangersous situation with a relatively small Ukrainian unit trying to do safe surrender for a larger Russian unit. If there had been more Ukrainians than there were then the Russians should have been moved in smaller groups, checked and disarmed and then the others sorted separately. In that case, killing the ones that had already been checked and 

>  Openly criticizing war crimes as specified by the Geneva convention (not rules that you just make up in your head) is not supporting Russia. 

No, but deliberately spreading falsehoods about war crimes in a war where there are already plenty of such is very very dodgy indeed. You clearly haven't bothered to put much effort into understanding this and yet you are here blaming people who were doing their best in difficult circumstances. 

Given the tendency for the Russian side to act exactly as you are and, in fact given that the videos of this incident have been released deceptively edited by the Russian side and you are pushing the same narrative as those that pushed deceptive edits, you are clearly either negligent or in conspiracy with people who are supporting war crimes. 

> If you don’t believe you can support Ukraine while criticizing the isolated incidents of war crimes that some of their soldiers have committed, then there is something seriously wrong with you.

I'm on clear record here demanding Ukraine investigates accusations of war crimes that have been made. 

Actual words have real effects here. By making false accusations here, you may cause Russian soldiers who would otherwise have surrendered and lived to fight in hopeless situations or even kill themselves. You may also put Ukrainian soldiers attempting to accept surrenders into danger and make others less willing to take risks to accept surrender. You have a responsibility to inform yourself.

Note that I feel the actions in the video are abhorrent, but not illegal. War is hell, and it is naïve (and the privilege of the non-combatants observing) to assume soldiers should at all times make the most sound judgements when in combat and their very lives are at stake.

Since your such an expert on perfidy, you should know what tends to happen to soldiers who become acclimated enemy combatants engaging in this type of deception- They become increasingly leery of surrendering solders and less willing to extend the proverbial olive branch.

Add to that, false surrenders are also a war crime. 

When this guy came out, gun blazing trying to be a hero, it's no longer safe for the would-be captors. Besides the general panic and stress of that situation, they can't be sure this wasn't an elaborate trap of some sort and that the surrendering soldiers aren't about to do something.

No, that's the merit-order system in the European energy market. You always pay the cost of the most expensive producer. Usually that's nuclear (unless you are France and cheat by capping the cost below market value and subsidizing the company), but with the inflated gas price that's now gas.

They would have been searched and restrained. At that stage they would have become a surrendered prisoner of war.

This is why I hope to see Kadyrov’s clan removed from power in Chechnya. How does someone call themselves a leader while brutalizing their own in the interests of their genocidal occupiers? Family profession, I guess. 

Kadyrov put a $1M bounty on Chechen resistance fighters back in March(?), which was astonishing because people in Chechnya could have benefited from that money.

Well, international humanitarian law completely disagrees with you there.

* The Ukrainian _active soldiers_ are as such legitimate targets, they are part of ""the game"".

* The surrendering Russian soldiers are not anymore, they are hors de combat, protected persons. They need to be spared and protected even if that leads to disadvantages for the other party, including loses.

>They will take prisoners if it's absolutely safe for them to do so,

* That is not how it works. And that is why we have the law, no party would like to take prisoners without the law, because it is always risky and it always has costs. 

* We don't know so far if it was justified, an accident or a war crime. But being the victim of a crime of aggression, doesn't change the rules about POWs. And from the moment there is a clear message they are surrendering and they are not showing hostile behaviour, they are protected, no matter who the aggressor is. And that is to be judged person by person. 

* So if the ones on the ground showed also hostile behaviour (which is with the footage we know very unlikely), or if they were shot in an accident or in error, it is not a war crime. If they were engaged intentionally and not in error or even executed, it is a clear and gross violation of the Geneva convention/protocol.

>the only person responsible for the lives of Russian troops is Putin.

He is primarily responsible, sure. But soldiers controlling surrendering hors-de-combat are naturally responsible for their safety and that they don't do harm to them, also."

It remains the fault of Russians for launching the missile they were reacting to. 


No one could fault them for this situation, proving them lying could jepodise some support from other countries because they lack transparency on the use of donated supplies some of which have come with conditions of what they can and can't be used against (US based systems cannot be used for targets in Russia - shame Saint HIMARS can't hit the Kremlin)

That's not how it works.


They are all equally guilty of perfidy.



None of them made sure all of their comrades were disarmed and guns were dropped or unloaded. They all knew he was there and hadn't surrendered yet and didn't alert any one or call out a warning or tell him to cooperate. And I am pretty sure that some of them had the angle to see him standing with the gun.


It's possible that some on the ground were not aware that they were being used as pawns to ambush the UA as part of a false surrender. That doesn't change their culpability, just as everyone in an armed robbery is equally guilty of everything that happens. It doesn't matter if the driver never held a gun. If you want to surrender, make sure all your pals are disarmed and send the hotheads out first.



Those men on the ground were also not yet POWs. They hadn't been searched and taken into custody. If the UA had actually executed confirmed unarmed and restrained men in custody, then that would be a war crime. This absolutely was not one."

Russians are already humiliated when they didn't achive their objectives right away. If you want to compare they are in the post WW1 or beginning of WW2 phase already. Just look what they do in Ukraine. For them losing occupied territories is already a defeat of russia. So how can they not be humiliated? Maybe they actually need to, to wake up. Also, Ukraine don't seek to conquer russia.

If someone think Ukraine should make concession they just need to look at the same Germany pre-WW2 to see what appeasement will do or a russia itself after 2014. There should be no trophies for effort either and no statements with double meaning to actually discourage them from continuing.

I think we are already past the point when there can be some change in russia under current circumstances, so military defeat might actually sober them up a bit.

>To not let Russia win will have the outcome we all want. A free Ukraine but also leaves the door open for a change in the future in Russia itself to finally change to the better.

For me it doesn't sound like that at all. Some thought Ukraine was 'free' pre full scale invasion with parts of territories occupied by russia.

Military defeat will make them more and more angry in the future. A perspective and reintegration into Europe without military threats and clear demands for never waging wear and giving up nuclear weapons (or like stationing them in Wladiwostok idk)
or a prohibition of arming up again or whatever could be an outcome but giving a perspective is important.

>Truthfully all the negotiations pushers are doing disservice to Ukraine, intentionally or not. 

I don't think so in general but yeah. Many people want just the war to end and make business with Russia again and have cheap energy and resources but that's not what Olaf Scholz or other negotiation pushers want (I believe, I could be wrong)
Reparations of course and the full territory needs to be given back to Ukraine. While we are at it a referendum in the occupied areas of Georgia aswell should be held under UN eyes.

OFC, who doesn't? It'd be a mistake though to underestimate the Chinese because the Russians are currently getting disassembled. Completely different regimes, and I'd take any military threat coming from the PRC seriously.

From the article I linked, and I hope you agree that Sutton is a reputable source:

> From a sea of disbelief, ASBMs are a being taken increasingly seriously. Particularly China’s ambitious program. Like any new weapons there will be challenges. And many systems may not be as capable in an operational setting as advertised. But the direction of travel is clear. And China seems determined to make it a reality.

So yes, this might not be a threat now but for sure this is giving the USN headaches regarding potential counter-measures. It's a sign of superiority that they've been so far able to develop sufficient counter-measures for all these threats, but it'd be a mistake to simply hope that the terminal guidance for ASBMs never reaches a status where it can target a carrier within a 13nmi radius of its original position."

I mean, I've already given you the proof. If you don't wish to accept it, that's on you.

>That's the definition of ad hominem.

Wrong.

Here, I'll simplify it for you:

ad hominem: ""You're wrong because [something about you as a person]""

Not ad hominem: ""You're wrong because [valid reasons] and therefore an idiot.""

I mean, try thinking about this, if you feel up to it: why would simply insulting someone be a logical fallacy, which ad hominem is? If someone is legitimately wrong and advancing an ill-founded argument, as you are in this thread, pointing out why and then calling them a moron is still advancing a valid argument, albeit impolitely. There's nothing logically incongruous about that. If someone tried to advance an argument like, say, ""It's snowing and therefore global warming is a myth"", pointing out why that's a really stupid argument and calling the person dumb in response isn't being logically fallacious, it's being honest.

By contrast, if you responded to ""It's snowing and therefore global warming is a myth,"" by saying, ""That's wrong, because you don't live somewhere where it snows, so you have no idea what you're talking about,"" that *is* an ad hominem and logically fallacious because your argument (""You don't live somewhere it snows"") has nothing to do with whether or not their argument is correct. Hence, logical fallacy.

Seriously, if you're going to use what you probably consider to be complicated words, at least learn what they mean. I shouldn't have to be correcting you on things this simple."

What I see: is that after the Russian came out shooting, Ukrainians took casualties but eliminated the shooter. Russians properly surrendering now all dead on the ground, unmoved. 

My take: could they have all been killed in crossfire? Sure, it is a possibility, but they were stretched out and behind one another, that some would have been meat shields for their comrades, so unlikely. Mortar or artillery? Unlikely, they would have sought cover. 

After shooter was eliminated, they remained prone because they were still being covered by Ukrainian rifles. My guess is that the unit vengefully, extrajudicially executed the remaining captives to atone for their deceit and inflicting casualties during a truce. I find this more believable, and unfortunate, that there was a lapse in judgement. Shit happens in war, and it’s not pretty. Can’t look at things black and white, and good versus evil. The good guys make mistakes.

Similar to countless times in WWII when allied forces would instead execute prisoners due to similar circumstances, or when they round up Concentration Camp guards and would just shoot them instead of letting them hang or serve prison sentences. Outcome is the same, yet one is right and the other is wrong.

My uncle said that there were white sheets, as far as the eye could see, it almost looked like it had snowed.

To be frank, China is light years ahead of Russia in regards to actually having their shit work (that being said, their fuck in Ukraine is far beyond what anyone in our IC thought possible), and the fact they have self awareness to deficiencies in their sabre rattling plans is a sign of ability to acknowledge and action items of progress - reminiscent of the Soviet Union in the 1980s honestly.

I have no idea why you would equate ""magic"" with non-Christian belief systems, but even if that were the case, people voluntarily converting between religions isn't a crime or even morally questionable. And, again, if they voluntarily chose to destroy their own possessions, that's their own right and choice.

>Universities got started after the Crusades. When the Christians visited the Middle East and learned about madrassas, and brought that idea back along with the looted books the Muslims had preserved. 

Why would Christians need to see madrasas to suddenly get the idea for universities when they were already running cathedral-schools that did much the same thing as the madrasas were? Moreover, it's worth noting that, by the time of the Crusades, the Mu'tazilism school of thought in Arabic countries that had led to much of the scientific advancement of the Islamic Golden Era was in sharp decline (criminalized, in some areas) and had largely been replaced by Ash'ari, which largely spurned and was openly hostile to scientific inquiry in the Middle Ages. Furthermore, madrasas in the Middle Ages were established under waqf, which left them heavily beholden to the Islamic authorities of the era; accordingly, very few taught anything outside of what was considered the ""Islamic Sciences"" - Koranic studies, grammar, sharia, and hadith; anything outside of this sphere, which was deliberately designed and constrained to focus on the study and interpretation of Islam, was largely ignored by the madrasas of the era. Crusades-era madrasas were so different in both structure and philosophy to early universities, it is extremely unlikely that the former inspired the latter to any significant extent.

>That is the origin of universities, not the Christian church.

Even if your claim was true (and it isn't), that wouldn't mean that it wasn't the Christian church that founded the universities. That they saw someone else passing on education and thought, ""Say, that's a good idea!"" doesn't suddenly mean they're not responsible for the founding anymore.

>And then the Renaissance starts

At which point you're now in the 1500s and have basically skipped over three-quarters of the church's existence.

>And the religious universities were forbidden to non-christians, but it's the Jews and the Muslims and with the medical expertise.

Ignoring the significant advancements that early-era Christians made to medical science. Christians were some of the foremost medicinal practitioners of the early first millennium. Famously, the first hospitals were founded/invented by Christians and the First Council of Nicaea in 325 decreed that any city large enough to have a cathedral should also have a hospital, effectively providing the world's earliest form of socialized medicine. By the latter half of the first millennium, every monastery also included an infirmary for the treatment of the sick and infirm.

>It's a bigoted myth that the Christians are responsible for modern scholarship.

Hell of a strawman to try to twist what I've been saying into an argument that ""Christians are responsible for modern scholarship.""

Please restrict your arguments to what I've actually said, not what you've made up in your imagination."

One example is a reduction of European aluminum production due to the high cost of generating electricity in Europe right now.  Shortages are a major driver of inflation. Wonder why the federal banks keep raising interest rates but inflation is very slow to come down? It is these shortages driving inflation. So now everything you buy costs 10% more, and with interest rates rising many are seeing their mortgage or rent costs going up massively.

In this case, the process of arriving at this estimate seems pretty simple. The original number of 2000 was probably given out by Russia, either to show their strength, or because of treaty obligations, like their statements about how many tanks they had.

The number 120 is no doubt based in part on the number of missiles fired. Based on range and explosive power, and sometimes on fragments with identifying marks, Ukraine and the US agencies can make pretty good estimates.

Estimates of continuing production of new missiles in Russia would be made in part based on production figures from before the war, modified by a rise if it is thought Russia can ramp up production, or a drop in sanctions are thought to be effective. If sanctions have been effective, then production depends on components scavenged from dishwashers, toys, phones, etc.

Both Ukrainian and US intelligence would be likely to release a low estimate, to show Ukraine is winning but the war is not yet won. Also, the fact that Russia is now using their missiles sporadically is an indication they are starting to run out."

I am sure West have been involved in moving Ukraine closer to their side but it's not like you have to do a lot of convincing. West offers democracy and growth while Russia dictatorship and stagnation. I am sure that if at least a single ally of Russia would live that good life it would be easier for them to keep othrr allies. Unfortunatelly that is not the case and some countries see it earlier or later but at the end they want to live better and be free at certain point. And if Russia does not offer it then why is it so weird that countries decide to move away?

India has a querelle with Pakistan, a country born because of a Muslim Hindu split orchestrated by the UK. In the 70s the only country that supported India in a Indo-Pakistani war was the USSR while the west supported Pakistan. This led India to isolate itself until the 1990s but also made India keep good relations with Russia. India has imported many Russian weapons as a way to meet ends before having an all Indian MIC. Do I think India is acting rationally? Kinda. They are buying oil from someone they trust, but I also think India is acting a bit irrationally.

That was true in essence. Russia hasn't made any progress since early summer when their offensive capabilities culminated with the taking of Severodonetsk. 

Sorry, they managed to take the great village of Pisky (18 pop, 2000 pre-war) in exchange for Kherson and Kharkiv...

Or (this is the part you ignored when you changed the statistic ""armed"" to mean a gun, he said ""less than charging with a rifle"") the large amout of force dissparity shootings(six cops light up a guy with a brick in his hand, 12 cops shoot a guy with a knife, cop shoots a guy with a can of mace), shootings that would not be allowed under our military rules of engagment. 
You still wouldnt be taking in to accout that every independant review ever done (including a review by the FBI, they were upset about it because all cop fatalities are supposed to be reported to them) found fatalities by cops are under reported by nearly 50% The problem isnt cops 'illegally' shoot people, its that cops are free to shoot legally with a hell of a lot less provocation that our soilders can. In what world is cops murdering 20 unarmed compliant people ok? 
You also seem to think cops/justice system have nothing to do with statistical drivers. Also why did you make this about blacks? Ah wait, I see it now.

Initially there might have been some merit to it - but Ukraine has proven it can:

\- protect valuable weapons systems when they're given to it & not lose them e.g HIMARS

\- follow rules given to them as to the usage of weapons systems (even if these rules are somewhat unfair) e.g told by US not to use HIMARS to launch directly into Russia itself)

\- has proven it's prowess on the battlefield and that it is no pushover, where any aid is wasted

\- is overwhelming abiding by the Geneva Convention and Intl Law - so will not embarrass donors by using weapons to kill civilians (cough cough - like Russia!)

It's like many Western countries are trying to barely give Ukraine enough weapons to squeak out a victory or stalemate.  Most of the weapons the West has WERE SPECIFICALLY BUILT TO DEFEAT RUSSIA - so why not give them to Ukraine a lil rapider?

The longer this shit drags on it only advantages Russia - as he's counting on Western nations losing interests/Govt changes etc - he'd have liked to have won in 3 days but will be very happy if it takes 3 yrs. We need to give UA what they need, stop dragging our feet on it."

Putin did spend a good deal, restoring silos and submarines to operational status, but 22 years have passed. Unless he has kept his personal eye on these forces, records have been falsified and parts sold, to enrich local commanders. All indications are that corruption is worse in the Russian military today than it was in 2000. I doubt Putin himself has anything like a precise idea of how many working nukes he has. But ...

Whether Putin has 20 or 400 working nukes, that is enough to cause real deterrence in the West. Deterrence works whether backed by real strength, or by a sufficiently convincing bluff.

In 1949 (?) when the Russians set off their first atom bomb, President Truman asked for a report on the status of American nuclear forces. The report was prepared with blanks for the numbers, which were only given verbally. I believe those numbers were later revealed to be:

 - Number of working atom bombs = 0
 - Number of working atom bombs in 2 weeks = 4
 - Number of working atom bombs in 2 months = 4 
 - Number of working atom bombs in 6 months = (I do not know this number. I believe it was an increase to something between 8 and 20.)

Needless to say, these numbers were highly secret until the 1970s. All 4 of the available bombs were of the Nagasaki type. The US immediately started a program to build more and bigger bombs, culminating in the original Hydrogen bomb, or ""Super."" At the same time, a much smaller program to build the smallest possible bomb, using a minimum of plutonium or uranium, was started."

His investigation was limited to the Trump campaign, ignored the rest of Trump finances. It went after the relative outsiders who were in the Trump campaign like Manafort, while ignoring the wider corruption in Congress, people like Devin Nunes.

It was estimated back in 2016 that Putin had bought the influence he had for about the cost of an F-35 fighter jet, maybe $150 million. I find that number unconvincing. From other sources the total amount of illegal campaign contributions going into the Republican Party in 2016 was about $3 billion. I find that number convincing.

$3 billion is a lot less than the US is pumping into the Ukraine War in a week, these days. (Most of that is spent at aerospace factories, and it's doing the US economy a lot of good, but never mind that.) I don't know what the Russians are spending on the Ukraine War, but between sanctions, lost oil/gas revenue, expenditures for arms, insurance payouts, etc., it could be costing Russia $3 billion in a week or a month.

In the USA the pro-Russian party just won the House, which means Biden's abilities to support Ukraine are extremely hampered.

In 2024 Trump is expected to win, who has shown himself very pro-Putin, absurdly so.

The Swiss's internal politics are anti-Ukraine for a variety of complex reasons.

The eastern EU nations, ignoring Hungary, and pro-Ukraine but generally have low resources, or can't just fund the UA on their own.

Western EU nations are already talking about Ukraine fatigue, costs, and peace settlements. Germany never truly supported Ukraine past a basic level, France wants a settlement immediatly, and Spain has limited arms, and the UK's new Tory minister may or may not change course.

So who is going to supply Ukraine now? During a recession with Putin talking nukes constantly? Worse, Russia still has a powerful economy and can make arms and arm soldiers non-stop for years, if not decades. Is Europe going to bet against this? Are they ready to support Ukraine for many years of warfare?

SO yes its easy to resupply them, and they should, but global politics is moving rightward towards fascism and oligarchy and against democracy in nearly all Western nations.

I have worked with so called ""dormant"" accounts at UBS before and I know the exact rules and how they were created and in which timeline.  

____

First of all they claim that numbered accounts aren't truly anonymous. This is a lie! The source they link to is a document from 2011 about client identification at UBS. This document was created **after** the scandal to prevent future scandals and has nothing to do how numbered relations were handled in the 1940s or before. Before electronic records a numbered account *could* be completely anonymous if the client wanted it. The name of numbered accounts internally at UBS is ""Countremarque"" the french word for counter mark even if you google this you won't find much I guess nobody ever bothered to explain this to the public but basically numbered accounts (before electronic records) worked like this:  

* The bank creates a number for you and all records simply refer to this number instead of your name (hence the name numbered account). 

* You in return get something that identifies you as the ultimate beneficiary of the account / the owner (hence the name counter mark). 

Basically the same as safe deposit boxes where the bank would have one key and the client would have the other one.
Normally the client advisor **and only** the client advisor would also have a record of your name linking it to the account but technically speaking this was not required or if your client advisor would quit / die the information would die with him. Of course most clients would be in contact with their client advisor and make sure their mandate would be taken over but for people who died in WW2 or the holocaust this wasn't the case.

____

Now that this is out of the way let's talk about the dilemma of how the scandal happened and why I think it came to light / why everyone to this day is still talking about it. First of all, UBS didn't simply pay back the money they ""stole"" (stealing isn't the right word in my opinion but I will get to it later) in their settlement they paid about 40 times (!!!) the amount of the money in these dormant accounts and even if you factor in inflation and no they did not pay it to the actual descendants of the accounts but to a group representing ""holocaust victims"" in general so the people who benefited from this settlement were very likely not even descendants of the ""victims"" (I also have a problem with calling them that and will explain why later). It's also funny that it is never mentioned what the amount was. The amount on these dormant accounts was about 24 million Swiss Francs in 1999 (roughly 1:1 in USD nowadays back then way less).  

Okay I already explained how numbered accounts work in the first part of my comment now let's talk about how the rules are nowadays and work our way back.  

Have you ever thought about how the bank would know that you died?  
What if they had no way of contacting you?  
Have you ever thought about how your descendants would know that you have a bank account?  
What if you didn't have a single piece of paper linking you to the account in your documents?  

First of all nowadays opening an account without giving a valid residential address is impossible partially because of the new laws to prevent scandals like these and because of tax concerns even numbered accounts will now have an address on record and because they are electronic handing the mandate of an account over to another client advisor is easy. But in the mid 1900s it wasn't that straight forward. Numbered accounts would rarely have an address associated with them and even if they had one the bank would **never** send any mail to that address or even mention the address on any documents. The reason for this is simple: The very reason you would get a numbered account for was so nobody would know it existed. For example if you were a German jew and in fear that your possessions would get confiscated by the Nazis and you got a numbered account you would know that there was no way for them to get to it. Even if they would ask the bank the bank simply wouldn't even possess the information that you had an account. This is the very reason numbered accounts and the bank secrecy law existed to protect your account from anyone who wanted to get to your assets. The irony here is that Swiss banks then in the 1990s were then crucified for sticking to this principle of never revealing the identities of their clients.  

So the only way the bank would know that you are dead / or likely dead was if either one of your descendants showed up with a death certificate or if they could assume you were dead because you'd be 100 something years old by the time. There simply wasn't another way back then and the bank actually had no obligation to do anything other than holding on to your money. Nowadays they basically have to prove that they had contact with you at least every 24 months and after that they have to ""do their best"" to either find you or your descendants but these rules were not created until the 2000s before there simply was no precedent to what would need to be done or what was expected.  

So imagine now you are the bank. The explicit purpose of a numbered account is to be as anonymous as possible. All you have is an account number and maybe a name and a 50+ year old address in a country that doesn't exist anymore / is currently split in 2 (cold war). You can now either publicly look for the original owner of the account, which would be against the secrecy law and against the purpose of a numbered account. Or you can say nothing and wait for someone to claim the account.  

Now the rules are that after the 24 months of no contact they go looking for the owner, if they are unable to find the owner (reasonable effort based on account value and information they have) they would hand over the assets to a public advocate who would publish the owners name in a public directory of abandoned assets for 12 months and after that all unclaimed assets go to the Swiss state.  

____

Now the last point and this is what truly pisses me off about this situation, the role of the USA in this whole scandal and why everyone knows about it and talks about it to this day, why there is so much misinformation etc.  

The USA are a bunch of hypocrites and we all know it but actually this entire case, sorry if I sound like a conspiracy nut here but it's actually true if you think about it for more than a second, was just a ploy for them to undermine the Swiss banking secrecy law because they were so god damn salty that they couldn't collect every conceivable tax dollar possible from their citizens. Why am I saying this? The law suit was brought against UBS and other banks in the USA not in Switzerland. Even though none of the actual events occurred in the US. The US granted asylum to the ""whistleblower"" and gave him a nice payday of USD 250k (ironically he returned to Switzerland a decade later without a penny because he and this are his own words ""there exists no social system in the US""). The US media also did a nice job of sensationalising this story and as you can see from the state of the wiki article rarely bothered to stick to the facts. The claimants of the lawsuit don't even have a direct connection to the assets that were at UBS they were simply opportunists that saw a chance for a lawsuit thanks to holocaust outrage. During the entire lawsuit the US heavily pressured Switzerland to undermine it's bank secrecy laws. And from the beginning the government of the US involved itself heavily in the lawsuit. Also the fucking commission they created to find dormant accounts cost CHF 300 million to run just to find only 95 million (24 million actually linked to victims of Nazi Germany)

____

Anyway nobody will give a shit about my comment and keep spreading these falsehoods about Swiss banks, Nazi gold and how they stole money from Jews but just read the summary of the report in the actual article about the law suit and tell me it wasn't just a fucking clown show and in the end the settlement was just to show ""sympathy"" to the victims of the holocaust where some rich US Jews and the US government (and the state of Israel) profited by exploiting the story of some unfortunate souls who perished in the holocaust.

It's not of course. Have you look at the first video, news flash there was a Russian soldier who started shooting. This was no surrender it was a ""trap"" (which btw is a [war crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrender_(military)#False_surrender)), and the soldiers on the ground were part of it, either implicitly (hidden weapon or grenade) or tacitly.

If they had another 10000 missiles and could keep firing them continuously at a 100/day than they might be able to do that.

If the countries of Europe will contribute their stockpiles, a very large amount of non-grid-stressing power generation can be installed in a very short amount of time.  Many of these can be installed directly on buildings in Kyiv and hooked up immediately to the grid.  I'm assuming Kyiv gets something like 3-4 daily hours  of sun per day, so they are less efficient than putting them in the southern US desert where I live, but still perfectly economically viable *even outside of an emergency situation*.  For an emergency situation it's simple - you need one person to drive a truckload from Europe to Kyiv, another dozen or so people to do routine mechanical work to install them, a construction leader to coordinate the placement, and an electrician to handle the connections.   It's a very easy DIY task. At around USD$1.50 per ""watt"" for the equipment and 2.5 hours of production per day (both fairly conservative guesses), that's something like USD$1.60 per kWh ammortized over the first year.  Which is both a lot for one year, yet also means 5-10% ROI even compared to peacetime electricity values.

 In July, when a critical deal was brokered by the United Nations and Turkey to free up millions of pounds of desperately needed Ukrainian grain, India played an important behind-the-scenes role in helping sell the plan to Russia, which had been blockading the grain ships.

 Two months later, when Russian forces were shelling the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine, leaving the world anxious about a nuclear catastrophe, India stepped in again and asked Russia to back off.

 Throughout the Ukraine war, India has quietly assisted during a few pivotal moments like these. This week, India’s foreign minister is traveling to Moscow for meetings with Russian officials on economic and political issues. Diplomats and foreign-policy experts are watching closely to see if India can use its unique leverage as one of the world’s largest countries that is a friend to both East and West to press Russia to end its war in Ukraine."

This is not hyperbole but documented truth and a real challenge to our ability to replace stockpiles.  There is direct concern in the Pentagon about our ability to provide support to Asia especially if conflict spreads to multiple areas.   America has developed past its strong industrial roots into a nation of poorly educated native born citizens who have disdain for low paying  hard labor jobs or the education necessary to be trained to produce high tech equipment, and it is also a nation of well-educated white collar workers who prefer working from a computer at home.  The conflict over immigration has weakened an immigrant work force that could provide the necessary labor to produce defense equipment and until this problem is resolved America will either risk being forced to isolate or run low on weaponry to protect itself.  We can't just snap our fingers and be the arsenal for the world any longer.   Ironically there are nations like South Korea who still have a strong skilled industrial work force who can supplement weapons to Europe and Asia and this is occurring as once sure American defense contracts are being replaced by south Korean ones."

Listen, war sucks and I’m not saying I’m a fan of what happened, but I watched the video and I’ve examined the pictures of the aftermath. The truth is, we don’t know exactly how it all went down, but what we do know is that while the Russians were surrendering, one f***ing Russian decided to run out with a machine gun and opened fire on the Ukrainians. The video doesn’t show executions. In fact, what it seems to show is that all hell broke loose when the Russian open fired. I suspect that when this happened, the Ukrainian soldiers considered every Russian a combatant at that point and just started spraying. If the Ukrainians eliminated the armed Russian and then proceeded to execute the remaining Russians one by one, then we,ve got ourselves a war crime. But there’s no evidence that this is what took place.

Analogously, the Russian co-participant attempted murder, so all the rest are guilty of attempting murder, maybe.  But what they were was surrendered combatants, not yet searched in a setting in which their buddy just proved he possessed a murderous weapon.  What's to say the UA fighters did not expect that any one or more of the men on the ground was hiding a hand grenade or two?  Only Russian idiots would stand nearby to search men like that in any close quarter.  Only Russia thinks that while it snips testicles, these 2 men, that's 2 covering 6 or 8, could make this situation safe?  Maybe asking each man to stand up and strip off all their clothes, to stand naked, to verify they were weapon free would have been snippy's approach, as in BullShit, would have been the best choice.  Only Russia would expect this would happen in a chaotic battlefield situation.

But if you're a vatnik living in Crimea you've got a problem. Crimea was annexed, it was formally part of Russia and so on. Not like the LNR and DPR fake states, much less the occupied areas. Putin's annexation meant that areas that weren't even under Russian control, and areas where they were being pushed back were now _also_ formally part of Russia just as much as Crimea was. So much for Russia's inviolable borders. Retreating from Kherson and then pretending nothing much happened and it didn't really matter just added further insult to injury.

These are not weapons that are being repurposed. These are weapons that were designed purely to hard counter Soviet tech like a game of rock paper scissors that Russia quit keeping up with 40 years ago. Even if their equipment was all in pristine and well maintained condition, these weapons would still be devastating. Nobody seems to really mention the nature of these things being designed specifically with Russia in mind, but it clearly matters. 

That all being said, war is a short term kicking of the can, not a solution. The world pointing weapons at each other is no way to live, and we are still very much in the dark ages here. I can only hope that the post putin Russia is a little less venomous with it's intentions. Yeah, the west is corrupt and has a lot of problems. But a corrupt and horrible parallel is not the solution, especially not when it's even worse than the order it stands to counter. 

Humanity is in for a dark road ahead as the consequences of our unsustainable society start catching up to us more and more. This is the precious window of time that we should be spending working together to change and mitigate these unfolding disasters. Instead it's looking like a decade of tensions and war. 

It's just a terrible shame all the way around. But for russias part in trying to make the situation even worse, they've certainly earned themselves the ass whooping that the bloated, obscenely runaway USA military industrial complex is gonna keep dishing out. And given the gravity of the global situation, it's hard to have empathy for their losses in such a stupid and selfish war. I do still have that empathy for them, I hate to see lives lost in war no matter whose they are, but it's really hard sometimes to resist a hardening heart that lets hatred creep in for some of these people, especially in the ruling and ultra wealthy crusts."

You don't actually have to have studied ABA though to know that if you reward someone for doing something, they're more likely to do that thing again in the future though.  That much is common sense.  If Ukraine rewards Russia with territory, who's to say they won't ever come back for more?  Who's to say they will never attack anyone else?  No, they need to learn that evil does not prosper long-term. 

Thankfully this war has been expensive for Russia, and has resulted in heavy losses in terms of personnel and equipment on their part.  Now they just have to end up with nothing to show for it, and that will send the message that unprovoked war is all-cost and no reward.

You aren't using that logic correctly. You are basically advocating for them to give up and then get re invaded.  

They are working on a military defeat up to whatever they can get whether that's at the border or even if not.

After that, there will be a guarantee from others to protect the borders.   This will happen regardless whether its giving Russia all it wants now or not.  So obviously Ukraine will take back as much as they can and then work on that peace after.

Russia if left unchecked yes would want to keep invading Ukraine and next Moldova.  Russia was close to/inciting fear in Moldova back around may that they were going to invade.  The only reason that stopped is because Russia got bogged down.

The answer to the question u have is yes: military defeat.

Also what right now we see happening is Russia is on the verge of the begging stages of falling.  Not that it will, but this is definitely in the direction it's going.  So Ukraine is capitalizing on that with their military defeat.  Its basically like saying kick them while they are weak.  It's about taking any advantages along the way regarding weakening Russia that will make future aggression unlikely bc it takes time to get back the momentum they lost.  And in that time, its also possible that coupled with a weaker, more troubled Russia, there is a chance for Russia to change.  It's a very small chance but it's better than nothing.

To also sum it up: this is Ukraine's decision what they do with their country.  It's clear that right now there are people trapped in occupied zones and Ukraine has the upper hand and will work on freeing what it can  - until it can't. That's pretty much all you need to know."

However Russia has been defeated in every other way. There is no reason to believe they would get Donbas then go to Ukraine then Moldova, a NATO nation. 

So there really isn’t an answer. If Russian defeat is impossible may as well find a solution and force them to stick to it. After a cease fire, Ukraine can be massively reenforced and fortified beyond belief to ensure Russia can’t return. Or… just fight an endless war.

False premise. The Baltic states joined NATO, there are no nuclear weapons there, because Russia at the time negotiated for that. There is no reason to think the same would not have been the case with Georgia or Ukraine.

My point is that the Afghanis cared who ruled them and acted like every other country, choosing countrymen over foreigners. Just like after the civil war in the us, they wanted to integrate the Taliban.  But since our enemies were terrorists and not rebels or freedom fighters we never allowed them to make peace until we were losing.  By then it was too late.

lol as opposed to Europe that has been ruled by democracies since 1990.  Or maybe you meant Italy which transitioned in the 1970s. You probably meant the US where blacks could get lynched without charge until the 60s but had elections so it was a “democracy.”

This is actually what Mearsheimer thinks too. The thing with Mearsheimer is he thinks the world becomes stable by having great powers that let each other have their spheres of influence. Mearsheimer believes that the best strategy of a state is to increase its relative power to the point of achieving regional domination by relying on offensive tactics. He thinks the Russian invasion is the natural, unavoidable consequence of Ukraine not submitting to Russia. This is what a lot of people who blame the western world for the war think. That is why he has deluded himself into thinking Russia doesn't actually want Ukraine even though it takes a lot of mental gymnastics to think so."

However, I wouldn’t call if impossible or highly unlikely.  We need to remember that Ukraine’s counter offensive to take Kharkiv started only 2.5 months ago in early September and pushed past Lyman while Kherson saw a forced retreat well before the full retreat in a week ago.

Christmas is only a month away and the Russians are showing just how badly they’re struggling. Ukrainian drones and air forces keep pummeling the East Kherson region without suffering casualties and HiMARS has range to almost everything out of Crimea while winter approaches on a poorly equipped Russian army compared to Ukrainians receiving thousands of winter tactical gear from Canada and other places."

These are a problem for Ukraine. They're going to hurt. The good news is that Russia doesn't have many of them. 

The worst thing Russia could do with them is fire off only one or two a month but have daily sorties with the jets. It would lock down high end anti air and still hit strategic targets as needed.

Also pushing through Zaporizhia it has showed a lot more difficult given the amplitude of the front and also the trench warfare.

If you read my past comments on Xi, I’ve said a lot. His country is imploding from within right now, the Chinese people are actually even rioting. However, he doesn’t have his thumb quite firmly on them yet, that’s coming. I think he’s deliberately tanking his economy to move to a ‘Planned Economy’ so that they can be as self-reliant as possible. He needs his country as self-reliant as possible, so that no one can use sanctions against him, so that the West cannot affect his behaviour, or control it. 

The US has banned the sale of advanced chips to China, but Xi needs them. How can he get them? Germany stopped the sale of the chip factory to China, Canada has ordered Chinese companies to divest themselves of stock in our mines…where can he get the chips from, he needs them for his country. Where can he get them? He can get them from Taiwan of course. He has to try.

Xi was just offered the MRNA vaccine for his people again, and again he refused. Why? He’s shuttering mega cities, over and over and over again, businesses are going under daily, maybe even by the thousands. And with the real estate crash, people are losing all their hard-earned cash. I don’t know if you’ve been watching what’s been going on there, but it would blow your mind. Even Chinese people who are experiencing it can’t believe what they’re up against. But I believe things are going to continue to get worse. He needs his county situated just right, and they’re not there yet.. Also, Xi cleared his cabinet now, he got rid of the other faction, it’s all his own ‘yes men’ in power with him now. Now he’s in the same echo chamber that putin’s in.

We absolutely cannot give in, I could be crazy, but I think things are about to get a lot worse. I don’t believe any of them like each other, but to overcome the West, I wouldn’t put it past some of the players to join together.

Xi is watching all too closely to see how the world responds to Putin, because he’s waiting and biding his time until…

Would Xi really attack Taiwan as brazenly as Putin attacked Ukraine?

Hirohito's actual involvement was that of a man who knew what his country was doing was wrong, but he basically had no power to do much about it because the Japanese military had gone completely insane.

He decided to just stay quiet for fear of someone worse replacing him if he speaks out. And when it came time for peace, he was generally very regretful over Japan's behavior and was the first to start setting Japan down the path of pacifism.

Hirohito even dedicated the near entire upbringing of his son Akihito to making sure Akihito could reign as a figure of pacifism and diplomatic peace once Akihito became emperor. And Akihito did exactly that and is the main reason modern Japan is so thoroughly non-violent.

There's a lot of war criminals in Japan that got away with no trial at the end of WW2, but letting specifically Hirohito go free had a very large Return-on-Investment for maintaining international peace.

Hirohito's definitely got some complicity in him, but he was still far from the contrarian, spite-filled monsters Hitler was and Putin is."

Russia could NEVER form a military alliance with Mexico and host Nuclear weapons on the border with Texas. The United States would never allow it.

Same way China would NEVER allow the United States to host nuclear weapons on the Island of Taiwan. China would go to War before letting that happen.

It’s odd how many people was criticizing him for not getting to the table now that Putin was willing. 

This was that reason why. He knew about the decoy the negotiations Putin was wanting to push now, so that they could go for a full frontal invasion in the spring, just like they did at the beginning of this year.

Why would you waste your ammunition shelling something that is under your control when you could just plant bombs? Though Russia has targeted Ukraines energy infrastructure they have only targeted those that are not under their control.
It doesn't make any sense either why UA would shell their own plant. They're already having blackouts due to energy shortage. I guess only reason is to create false flage (prepare your tin foil hats): cause a huge nuclear disaster, let the radioactive cloud fly to nato country, activate article 5 and blame Russia.

Mearsheimer's realism is plain ignorant (and most realism is), it is intentionally disregarding the majority of the information we have, claiming that it is irrelevant. But just looking at the last 30 years, we see it is the most relevant part. 

This is not even about the ideological part - IR realism vs IR liberalism - it is about the analytical part. I never got the idea of analytical realism, it starts with a bunch of presumptions, which are obviously false for today (and i would say have been forever), which just come out of nowhere. I don't see how this could even be called scientific, this all starts with some pretty strong assumptions which are just set, and never demonstrated as correct. 

I think you are getting wrong that Mearsheimer is a ""crypto-fascist"". His ideology is based on his false analysis, and most of what he says is probably just caused by __intentional__ and __willful__ ignorance, not malice.

Let's take the main tenets:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_realism#Main_tenets

(1) is disputable, and it is actually two claims, and it was not like the big powers were actually the sole drivers of this conflict, but one could argue, that it was actually, on one side, not even a state actor at all, but the population of a middle or small power. The influence of the populations and groups with span over multiple nations are totally disregarded in the whole framework. Then there is the question of anarchy - this depends pretty much on how we define the term, I won't dig deeper into that.

(2) is largely correct.

(3) is problematic, because it starts again with the implicit notion, that states are actually actors which have intentions as such - not politicians, not groups inside states, not groups spanning over states, not the population. From my point of view, this statement as such doesn't even make sense, because it is not even possible to contribute ""intentions"" to a state - which is from my POV just plain stupid - an entity like a state is fundamentally unable to have intentionality. It is based on the old realist idea, that states are black-boxes, and as they are, and we anyway can't know what is going on inside, we just _intentionally_ disregard it and claim and presume they are coherent actors. I don't get how one could even get to such a crazy idea...

I also now and then say things like ""Russia"" wants - but I don't mean that literal - people like Mearsheimer do. Disregarding that e.g. ""Russia"" is an extremely complex system, which has no ""Will"" or ""Intention"" as such, but the demonstrated abstract ""Will"" is an effect of the complex inner workings and relations with the outer world.

(4) seems like a no-brainer, but it is not. This is more or less the old idea of realism, denying also that politics and ideology matter. And it also includes (5) already, that states are somehow rational actors. 

(5) this is again taking states as coherent actors, which is already an imho completely false notion (see above), but even claiming they act rational, and that in a particular framework and game and rules (those which realism also defines), what is obviously not the case. 

There is even much more critique about that, and even more about what is not there, and the focus on military means.

I'll stop that here. But tldr; - I think Mearsheimer deserves a much more fundamental attack, because not only his conclusions, which are well destructed by Continer are terrible, but already the whole theory, well, more ideology, he bases all of his analysis on, is just some ignorant BS."

They stretched article 5 beyond reason in Afghanistan and Canadians died as a result when what was really needed wasn't invasion but a SEAL team raid or raids as was ultimately ended Bin Laden. Some crticize Libya as well but I disagree as that was a UN sanctioned mission and NATO was more an organizing umbrella for individual participating states (Russia abstained).

The vote never happened because of that, if it had happened, probably more than 50% of NATO had denied to support it. And only one veto is necessary that it doesn't happen.

Ukraine and Georgia were in 2008 extremely far from actually getting a MAP - Ukraine also because of internal politics, corruption and so on, not just the struggles with Russia. People often forget that short after Yanukovych got to power (and it was back then not unexpected, Ukraine was alternating between ""pro-Russian"" and ""pro-Western"" leaderships), and nobody would have wanted to have that guy in NATO. 

---

>NATO and Ukraine have been flirting since early 2000s. Russia got scared they were close in 2014 when the president was overthrown,

Ukraine was not close at that point. Ukraine was close to become a part of the West in particular culturally and in respect to democracy, civil society and removing corruption etc.. What Putin feared there, is his extreme fear of Color Revolutions, and Ukraine becoming an example for Russia, in particular after the 2012 protests in Russia still being fresh. This was not about a fear for Russia, but about him fearing about his power and the power of his system and his ideology in Russia.

Btw. just some years before, Putin gave a presser together with Kuchma, not being scared of NATO in Ukraine at all, but still more or less saying, we (Russia) decided to have just good relations with NATO and integrate to some degree, it is up to Ukraine to choose there own way and decide themselves how far they want to integrate.

This only changed more and more getting closer to 2008, and when Putin saw that NATO is very unhappy about things like the invasion of Georgia, and might actually be a hindrance to Russia establishing and controlling a ""sphere of influence"" again. Not because of threats against Russia, they had been the same already in 2002, when Putin was still friendly with NATO.

It was not NATO which changed after that and suddenly became a threat, it was Russia and in particular Putin who changed and became more and more aggressive with the ""near-abroad"", and NATO - as a defensive alliance also incorporating nations there, was an obstacle to that.

Ukraine might in turn think that limited NATO involvement would allow them to continue fighting on the front with less risk to the western parts of Ukraine.  eg. ""no fly zone"" in the west.

NATO countries, for their part, have been extremely cautious, ensuring that it is Ukraine alone defending its own land, albeit with a lot of support.

What would cause NATO to get directly involved?  A stray missile?  Nope.  A radiation leak at a nuclear power plant?  Maybe."

UA was manned by a man who himself and his parliament and his government employees, corrupt... in US eyes, irredeemably corrupt.  When their apparatchik fled to Russia, there was enough money in their Treasury for 1 month's operation of the State.  It was siphoned off by corruption and kleptocracy.  Gee, the same activities as what are present today in Russia.  Such a surprise.

Russia's game of safety is to keep a ring of weak politically and militarily vassal states.  This war has demonstrated to those vassal states that Russia cannot protect them militarilly.  Their rulers needed Russian political protection to continue their games raping their own countries.  This game is now exposed, like the king has no clothes.  And this military defeat Russia is experiencing also knocks out the second promise to those vassals, that Russia would step up and keep the other tyrants and democrats away from them."

>My conclusion is that Putin saw Ukraine leaning away from him and towards the West/NATO. He belives this is a huge threat to Russias national interests. So he is trying to take a chunk out of Ukraine.

What you confuse here, and also Mearsheimer does, is Putin's interests, and Russia's rational interests. They neither have to be identical nor they are. Putin was primarily scared of Ukraine ""leaning West"" (actually also not ""Ukraine"", but the population and government, and not about geopolitics, but about ideas and ideologies). The risk to his interests was that Ukraine, ""the small sister of Russia"", had the real chance to become a successful democratic part of the West. And that Russians would see that, and would ask, why can't we have the same democracy, freedom and prosperity, Ukraine probably had gotten with the extensive EU-AA in the course of a few years. With his attacked on Ukraine he limited that process much. His fear was not primarily of NATO, but of the EU, not even the real EU, but the fundamental ideas of the EU getting hold in Ukraine."

They can feel it but they will never allow external reality to embarrass them.  Period.  They won't allow it.  They will do everything they can to beat back the source of the pain and inflict terminal pain on the person or group they see as the cause of the pain.  The life of others is meaningless to them.

I've seen this assertion going around Reddit ever since this video came out and it's completely false. If a soldier has surrendered by putting their hands up and following the enemy's commands, they've surrendered. Searching, disarming, and restraining them is good SOP, but it's not required for them to be considered POWs. If a group surrenders and one guy decides he doesn't want to, you don't have carte blanche to kill everyone.

Yes, the Russian who shot at these Ukrainians committed perfidy and could've been legally executed. The other Russians who were laying on the ground with their hands out were POWs who committed no crime. The Ukrainians committed a war crime by killing them."

Of course not.  But there is strong evidence that Musk was speaking with the Kremlin.

Firstly,  Musk *did not* deny speaking with the Kremlin.  He [only denied](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1579879154463690752) speaking recently with Putin.

This [excellent analysis by Fiona Hill](
https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/10/17/fiona-hill-putin-war-00061894) details the way the Kremlin plays powerful westerners.  

She describes the words Elon used, and draws a direct line between those and the Kremlin's talking points.  She has devoted her life to Kremlinoligy.  She clearly believes the that Kremlin played Musk.  Just as they've played so many powerful westerners before him."

It is in Ukraine's best interests if Russia focuses their efforts on defending Crimea rather than attacking the Donbass.  It is in Ukraine's best interests if Russia diverts their forces to Crimea, where Russia will have a far more difficult time maintaining [GLOCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_communication). Ukraine wants to fight Russia in Crimea, not the Donbass -- the war in the Donbass is not going great, because of how easy it is for Russia to continue reinforcing their positions there due to them having complete control over Ukraine's eastern border. 

Ukraine wants Russian troops in the Donbass, that's where they want to shift the battle. Ukraine will do whatever it takes to either influence or force Russia to move their troops to Crimea, including this constant talk of how Kyiv has Crimea in their sights -- this is all part of their plan, not just some random opinion of ""Ukraine's deputy defense minister""."

This is correct, he showed hostility, was not surrendering, and as an active combatant, he was a valid legal target. The debate is about the others.

I can see they got accidentally shot, or in error, or _after_ what we see in video 1, they acted hostile - I think the first two are most likely what happened. That would all not (necessarily) be crimes of war. If they were intentionally engaged just because of a perceived threat or risk or even in retribution, it would legally be a crime.

>You are not covered by international law when you yourself are violating it.

That is largely also incorrect. That he committed perfidy, actually doesn't invalidate the protection, what does invalidate it, is that he just didn't fulfill the conditions for the protection outlined in article 41 of the additional protocol anymore, as he acted hostile. That his hostile acting was also perfidy, only means that he in addition also committed a crime of war.

Loses of protection in IHL happen only, like they are explained in the part of the IHL dealing with those protections.

---

From the videos it is impossible to conclude if a crime of war happened or not, a further investigation is needed for that.

What the ombudsman says there is false, targeted retaliatory fire again a person who surrendered and didn't show hostility again, is illegal. And that is about each individual person, it is irrelevant what others do. The IHL in those parts clearly doesn't speak about ""groups"" or ""they"", but about ""person"" and ""he"". 

The Additional Protocol is absolutely clear about that, you can never target hors-de-combat directly. But it might either be not a targeted engagement or not intented to shoot at hors-de-combat. If they are e.g. caught in the crossfire, and it is not feasible and proportional to act so, it is not illegal that they got hit engaging the military objective, the soldier who was behind them committing perfidy.

That was my bad, however you're making a lot of assumptions based on a incomplete video, and one that does not show what happened after the gunman opened fire. It is all conjecture at this point, so while the fate of the gunman can indeed be justified, we cannot honestly hold an opinion as to what crimes were committed (if any) based on the lack of evidence. This requires an investigation before rough riding a decision. The video footage needs to be seen in it's entirety and witnesses needs to be spoken to. This may ruffle a few feathers on the ""Ukraine can do no harm"" team, but see this rather not as doubt but a gesture that both reminds the Ukrainian forces to continue adhering to the Geneva convention and also a signal to the world that Ukraine takes the rules of engagement seriously and is not the strawman the doubters that oppose sending aid to Ukraine see them as."

The fact is that speeches are just that - speeches. They depend on the audience. 

To get the underlying idea of Putin's goal one should take account the conflicts and resolvements of his entire career. Second Chechen War, Russo-Georgian War and now the war in Ukraine. NATO is just an excuse, the real problem is Ukraine's tendency to cooperate with Europe instead of Russia (applying for membership of NATO is the pinnacle of those tendencies - 28% of popular support for NATO in 2012 and 69% in 2017). Moreover, to get the whole picture, we should map all ""pro-Russia"" movements to get the idea of the possible agenda.

Also we should keep in mind that the conflict started not in 2022 but in 2014 when Little Green Men (aka Russian soldiers) entered eastern part of Ukraine and Crimea and started to escalate the conflict. I would even argue that the seeds of the conflict were laid when ""pro-Russia"" demonstrations broke out in some Ukraine areas (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014\_pro-Russian\_unrest\_in\_Ukraine). Interestingly, even in the Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk, there was no popular support for union with Russia (41.0% Crimea, 33.2% Donetsk Oblast, 24.1% Luhansk Oblast). After annexation of Crimea the results from a different poll show that majority of population did not want to be annexed by Russia (the combined percentage for the people opting for the options of ""Rather, no"" and ""Certainly, no, I don't"": 51.9% Luhansk Oblast, 52.2% Donetsk Oblast, 65.6% Kharkiv Oblast, 78.8% Odesa Oblast, 81.5% Zaporizhia Oblast, 84.1% Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, 84.6% Kherson Oblast, 85.4% Mykolayiv Oblast).

How did those ""pro-Russian"" protests appear when majority of population was not pro-Russia, we can currently only speculate. But since pro-European Euromaiden movement had been very popular, we can assume that generating unrest and pro-Russia movement would be in Russia's playbooks. (Instigation of local unrests are part of Russia's handbook of operations. Bronze-night in Estonia was organized by four instigators that got funded by Russian State Duma. Linter was later also part of DNR leadership: [https://www.stena.ee/blog/drug-putina-zyat-pushilina-kak-dmitrij-linter-%E2%80%94-chlen-estonskoj-bronzovoj-chetverki-%E2%80%94-voshel-v-](https://www.stena.ee/blog/drug-putina-zyat-pushilina-kak-dmitrij-linter-%E2%80%94-chlen-estonskoj-bronzovoj-chetverki-%E2%80%94-voshel-v-)).

Maybe you cannot call it traditional ""imperialism"" when you try to destabilize surrounding countries and keep your sphere of influence (from financing insurgets to threatening with conflict / starting a war), but it also is not explainable by ""threat from NATO"". Russian leaders know that NATO will never attack Russia by itself They choose to tell people otherwise."

A lot of the others would be aimed at military bases and heavy infrastructure (e.g ports and shipyards).
You have to also take into account the fact that a reasonable number of missiles will fail to launch correctly (just like space rockets), taking out multiple warheads each.

So if 90% of warheads in fact did not work, the number of warheads detonating on cites would be far less than 80."

If at anytime during you renew hostilities, you lose said rights as you are now an enemy combatant. In this video, the unit surrenders. They are coming out and laying down as per the orders from the Ukrainian forces I presume. This switches thier status from being an enemy combatant. When the one guy walks out, raises his weapon, he lost said status and all rights to a surrending force. He is now a combatant. He is no longer protected by that part of the Geneva convention. You can't yell I surrender and keep on fighting. That is what I was referring to, what so many knew what I was talking about, and so few didn't understand. 

My stance on the rest of the unit is unchanged. I don't see any evidence of anything so I can't draw a conclusion on it. They died and a Ukrainian soldier is dead. That's all we know."
