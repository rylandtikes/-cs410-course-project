Now? Modern nuclear warheads that are equipped on fighter jets pack **300 KT** or **x18** the power of those strategic weapons used back in WW2 and there are **tens of thousands of them.**


Now let's talk about the continent destoryers. The B83 Nuclear Bomb (ICBM) is a variable yield strategic weapon with an output of **1,200 KT** or **x75** the power of the weapons used to end WW2. 


**there are thousands of them in the active arsenal of the US.**

Whatever the response, It'll be well measured and considered.  Preferably they want Russia to take responsibility and pay reparations. If not they will ultimately want to plan out something that shows they respond to the exact threat presented against NATO but doesn't necessarily trigger Russia to escalate with a response to the response.

No one said it wasn't clear who fired it, only that it likely wasn't fired from Russian territory... which makes sense, since Belarus is MUCH closer to the impact site than Russia is. There isn't any reason *right now* to think it's an S-300, but figuring out the type of missile should be very easy for the Polish government... which seems to think Russia is responsible."

You would need to be 100% prepared to shoot down Russian aircraft without flinching. You have to hope Russia won’t intentionally violate it to either call your bluff and significantly damage your credibility for future NFZs, or force you to shoot down one of their aircraft so that they can escalate in other ways and use it for additional propaganda. 

Also, Russia (embarrassingly) does not have total air control. Ukraine is operating aircraft successfully. This makes the net impact of the NFZ less significant than situations where one side has established total air superiority against an opponent with insufficient anti-aircraft systems, allowing them to bomb with impunity. I am pretty that was how Russia planned for it to go, in which case a NFZ would be helpful, but still a dicey proclamation due to the reasons I mentioned above.

Giving Ukraine more advanced weapons with greater range and power that were previously withheld would be a more measured response."

You would need to be 100% prepared to shoot down Russian aircraft without flinching. You have to hope Russia won’t intentionally violate it to either call your bluff and significantly damage your credibility for future NFZs, or force you to shoot down one of their aircraft so that they can escalate in other ways and use it for additional propaganda.

And what other reaction you would expect?

If it's declared as russian missile (intentional, or not - does matter), only NFZ - at least in some buffer area around NATO - Ukraine border is a sensible option. This village is right at the border, so it's not like we can go with ""oh we can wait until it crosses into NATO territory and then we can shoot it down"".

Easy as that - russian shit goes into buffer zone, it gets shot down because russian proven themselves as incapable of respecting borders of engagement. Their only salvation would be if NATO declares that it wasn't russian, but i.e. Ukrainian S-300 going stray."

1668580620.0,iwk9ui6,t5_30hhs,0,1,Acrobatic-Till5092,0,"""Vranyo"" doesnt really translate well.  I learned it from a Perun video and then looked up myself, perhaps the most concise translation would be: ""a culture of knowing lies.""

Basically it means that everyone is telling lies, and that everyone knows everyone is telling lies, but that everyone is going to act as if no one is telling lies.

It is honestly a little difficult to comprehend  because of the scale involved.  I was reading an Estonian article that discussed how the West views Russia, and they brought up the fact that we tend to think Russian culture is - at its core - like our own.  That Russian culture is like American or European culture, when really it is as different as China's.

Some of the people interviewed in the article posited that after so many centuries under brutal totalitarian regimes, that things as simple as ""lies are bad"" isnt something neccesarily obvious to them.  Russians have to lie constantly, about their opinions, about current events, about everything, because if they day the wrong thing they will be punished for it.

A good example is how Russian Youtubers who left before the war in Ukraine won't call it a war.  When one of them responded to the questions of why he wouldnt, his response was: ""If I called that a war, I would be breaking the law, and I really want to see my family again.""

Truth is dangerous in Russia, and has been for hundreds of years.  As a result, so long as that is true, Russia is inherently untrustworthy.

The cure would be to remove the authoritarianism and allow enough freedom for people to not fear the truth, but unfortunately other aspects of Russias history have also introduced mistrust and disgust for democracy and elections.  Russia still had *serfs* not all that long ago, and their first brush with elections happened a little before World War One and was crushed by the Czar.  Their second attempt was during World War One and can only be described as a disaster, which led to the rise of the Bolsheviks.

After that was the Communist government of the USSR until the 90's, where the Russian Federation's President gets into - how shall I put this - a bit of a tussle with the legislative branch that involved massive riots and tanks firing on the legislature itself.

And after that is Putin.

What is notable is that every time they have attempted democracy it has been during a time of chaos and poverty.  And Putin has spent years working to delegitimize the concept of democracy further.

So many Russians will actively fight against a system that would remove the fear at the heart of ""vranyo"" from their society.

Russian culture is a reminder that cultural relativism is a terrible idea - or at least the type of cultural relativism that suggests that we shouldn't judge other cultures."

The name refers to the fact that the missile itself is only a passive detector of a radar signal—provided by an external (""offboard"") source—as it reflects off the target (in contrast to active radar homing, which uses an active radar transceiver). Semi-active missile systems use bistatic continuous-wave radar. The NATO brevity code for a semi-active radar homing missile launch is Fox One.

Iron Dome was designed to defend against an enemy who is spamming hundreds of low-tech unguided ballistic rockets. One of its best features is targeting software that automatically decides which rockets to intercept and which to leave alone by projecting the impact location and only wasting an interceptor on a rocket that is actually going to fall on a populated area. But that projection is based on the assumption that the incoming rocket is going to follow a ballistic trajectory. In addition, ballistic rockets fly up in a high arcing trajectory, which enables Iron Dome to intercept them at relatively high altitude.

None of these conditions apply to the threat Ukraine is facing. Cruise missiles and kamikaze drones do not follow a ballistic trajectory, they fly in at low altitude and are capable of independent maneuverability. Ukraine definitely needs more air defenses, but Iron Dome is the wrong tool to counter the threat they face."

Russian assets throughout the west agree.

 The rarely come straight out and say ""no money to Ukraine"".  Instead, they question whether money is disappearing. It isn't. -  Or whether it's being spent properly.  It is.  Both the US and EU have verification and validation programs in place.

> It’s also important to solve our many, many festering domestic problems. 

At least in the US, cutting Ukraine aid wouldn't move a dollar towards festering domestic problems.  This because Ukraine is a rare issue of bipartisan comity.   Festering domestic issues don't have the votes to pass the House and Senate.  Ukraine does.

If the goal is to fix festering domestic issues, make sure the Democrats win the House, Senate, and Presidency in 2024.  And the Senate by enough to kill the filibuster.  That's the only way those issues will see any funding.

>  The scale is tilted too far right now.

The west is receiving benefits that would be a bargain at 10 times the price.

Over the past 70 years, the west has spent *trillions*, yes, trillions, keeping the Russian bear at bay.  
 Ukraine is doing all the hard work, the west is merely providing the funding and weapons.  And the result will be a largely de-weaponized and defeated Russia.

This war should bring an end to Putin, and if we're lucky, an end to Russian dictatorship. Meaning one less power pointing nuclear missiles at the west, and a weakening of dictatorships the world over.

So yes,  funding Ukraine's defense is a bargain at ten times the price."

Honestly, I can't understand what the Russians are even trying to do.  Attacks on civilians have never worked to stop a military conflict - with one exception.  The bombings on London didn't stop them from fighting in WW2, and neither did the bombing in Berlin stop the Germans.  The American firebombing of Japan?  Nope, not nearly enough.  

We had to nuke them.  Twice.

And, just in general, dumb bombing campaigns or artillery fire that isn't guided is terribly ineffective.  The British bombardment of German lines in the Battle of the Somme in WWI?  Seven days of shelling and over a million artillery rounds fired only for the British to charge and be slaughtered.  Operation Rolling Thunder in Vietnam?  Killed hundreds of thousands of people, most of which were civilian, and accomplished basically nothing in the end.

I am not even arguing ethics or morals here - I am pointing out that it just doesn't work.  If you can't accurately and consistently hit military targets you are just wasting your ammunition and time for little - if any - gain.  The one time it did work the weapons in question became so reviled worldwide that their very existence is nearly taboo, to say nothing of their actual use.

Look, collateral civilian deaths during strikes on valid military installations is something - well, ""accept"" isn't the right word - grudgingly acknowledge as something that is inevitable.  There is no military on earth that can fight a war without civilian casualties or committing some war crimes.  The between Russia and most other countries is that Russia isn't making mistakes and having a few men out of hundreds of thousands be terrible people - civilian death and war crimes are *their entire plan.*

Worse still, it wouldn't even be hard to have shot those missiles at the transportation infrastructure in western Ukraine.  A few shots at Ukraine's rail lines would do so much to help their front lines that it is genuinely perplexing that they haven't done it.  It is as incompetent as it is evil."

The initial accusation came quickly and was very likely made (prematurely) before Kiyv had the information. They assumed, I don't think they lied. We are talking two hours or less, then night.

In the morning the clarifications are now being made.

Not sure who actually knew first. I think the US probably is tracking the Ukrainian airspace better than Ukrainians or Poles. So the Pentagon probably knew before Kiyv did. The Poles probably could have made the call late in the evening too, after surveying the wreckage. Though that's a bit technical, so it's again possible the information didn't quite make it to the politicians in time."

Particularly with pointing out that while Biden said preliminary information showed it wasn’t fired from Russia, that doesn’t rule out the Russians firing it from somewhere else, be it a Russian jet flying over Ukraine or Belarus.

A couple of observations for what they are worth.  

russia doesn't get to wash its hands of liability for this situation because the ordnance wasn't theirs.  The effort at Ukrainian self defence wouldn't have been required or deadly without russia conducting itself as a terrorist state.  It does however  mean that the gathering of ambassadors due soon at Poland's behest is unlikely to be considering any Article 5 response.

The speed and effort russia adopted to cry innocence was evidence they well realise inviting such a response is suicidal and to be avoided at all costs.  Moreover, the enthusiasm shown by  many (who took this to be targeted russian aggression against a Nato member) to unleash  previously restrained dogs of war must have been salutary to them.  The notion that a force all but on their border is governed by people just looking for the opportunity to fuck them sideways must give pause for thought.

There are increasingly few good options for russia's military in this war but inviting a legally mandated curb stomping can't be the best.  Knowing your only response at that stage is to invite the incineration of your people and nation in a nuclear exchange rather emphasises the nature of their problem.  russia has invaded Ukraine but is now deep in darkest Zugzwang."

If it was a Ukrainian missile following a Russian missile or drone, that doesn’t mean Russia is good, doesn’t mean they didn’t commit tens of thousands of war crimes, doesn’t mean they don’t deserve to be pushed out of Ukraine’s borders and tried in court for their crimes.

This is not an anti-Ukraine position. It’s just a pro-truth position.

And we even had the ministers of foreign affairs [claiming this was a conspiracy theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/ywboeb/the_russian_conspiracy_theory_about_the_fall_of/) earlier today:

>	“Russia is currently promoting a conspiracy theory that a Ukrainian air defense missile allegedly fell on the Poles. This is not true. No one should buy Russian propaganda or amplify its message. This lesson should have been learned long ago after the downing of MH17,”

Ukraine should win. Russia is acting like a terrorist state, kidnapping children, committing genocide, and every war crime in the book. But that doesn’t mean we should become blind. We should still wait for evidence, and be honest and careful in forming our own positions about things."

>At the end of September, about seven weeks before the start of the G20 summit in Bali, Konstantin* sees Russia already on the home stretch and writes a message. As a member of the delegation participating in the G20 preliminary negotiations on behalf of Russia, he feels that ""something is really happening."" He said his colleague and he were ""constantly being courted by Westerners.""
>
>Again and again, Konstantin said, representatives of Western countries stressed the importance of agreeing on a final declaration. At the end of his message he puts four closing brackets - common among Russian speakers instead of laughing emojis. The message goes to Yuriy*, who is his superior and apparently works in the Russian Foreign Ministry.
>
>For months, there has been behind-the-scenes wrangling over a final declaration for the G20 summit in Bali, one of the most important political summits in the world. Secret Russian negotiation documents and chat flows between members of the Russian negotiating delegation, which reporters from NDR were able to view, reveal Russia's strategy and show that the negotiators long did everything they could to keep terms like ""Ukraine"" or ""war"" out of the summit's final declaration. To do so, they also wanted to use their close contacts with supposed allies such as China, India and Brazil.
>
>The content of the documents, the names mentioned and the chronological sequence are plausible, even if their concrete truth content cannot be definitively verified. Formulations from a draft of the final declaration, for example, which the negotiators exchanged among themselves, match those from a draft published later.
>
>At such summits, it is common for all participating states to struggle for weeks or even months to reach a final summit declaration. In most cases, all countries try to reach a joint declaration and still accommodate important statements of their own without upsetting the other participants.
>
>Above all, the host, which in Bali is Indonesia, is trying to make a final declaration possible. The Russian delegation is also interested in finding a compromise. Thus, Yuriy writes to his colleague: ""For us, only one sentence is important: that states remember their own positions regarding the Ukrainian cause."" In this way, there would be no one-sided apportionment of blame. ""That would be a very nice outcome. But who knows whether Westerners will go for it,"" Yuriy added.
>
>At the time of the exchange between the two men, the Russian side is betting that at least Russian responsibility for the war will not find its way into the final declaration.

>It is also possible to infer Russia's general negotiating position from the conversations viewed by NDR: Russia is prepared to address Ukraine if the West accepts its responsibility for what happened and is also prepared to talk about the sanctions imposed on Russia.
>
>Konstantin, the man in the negotiating team, comes to the assessment in the chat: How flexible the countries will be in Bali will strongly depend on the current situation that then prevails in Ukraine. The Russian Foreign Ministry left an inquiry from NDR unanswered.
>
>But shortly after Konstantin's optimistic news, skepticism is spreading among him. ""The Westerners are playing a double game,"" he writes to his superior Yuriy in a long message with eight subheadings. ""On the corridors, they continue with bridge-building, bringing into play possibilities of finding a compromise: that a formulation could be found without condemning Russia."" 
>
>But things would look different on the ""official track"" - that is, in the official part: There, the representatives of the West would continue to push their line that there is a need for formulations such as ""Russia's aggressive war"" and a reference to ""Russia's condemnation and acceptance of responsibility"" in the final declaration. Fortunately, Constantine lectures further, emerging economies ""have so far responded confidently to [Western] pressure.""
>
>From the course of the two men's chat, it is clear how much Russia relied on the countries of the so-called BRICS alliance - named after the first letters of the associated countries Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - to push through its goals in the run-up to the G20 summit.
>
>But apparently there was also frustration: In the course of the conversation, Konstantin complains with some strong language to his superior in the Russian Foreign Ministry that the other BRICS countries would not sufficiently follow the formulations proposed by Russia with regard to Ukraine. For example, the Russian negotiators had proposed the phrase ""a multiplicity of conflicts"" instead of directly mentioning the Ukraine war in the final paper.
>
>In terms of behind-the-scenes sentiment, other clues can be found in the chat history. Despite complaints about the West's ""double game,"" Konstantin notes, ""Our contacts with Westerners are normal, there are business talks and friendly conversations, almost like before."" However, he says, the Australians and Germans are an exception. ""Even with the Americans, communication turns out to be smooth, sometimes even informal."" He goes on to report that ""in front of the microphone"" the Germans and French in particular ""act sharply.""
>
>But the disillusionment seems to have solidified within just a few days: ""Westerners continue to insist that it is important that the issue [Ukraine] be reflected in all 'relevant' paragraphs,"" even when it comes to energy. The goal, he said, is ""to try to justify themselves to their own citizens for energy prices and the trade deficit."" Behind the scenes, Western representatives make no secret of this, Konstantin reports to his home country.
>
>At the end of October, he finally shares with his superior the third draft of the English-language declaration, which NDR was also able to view. ""Oh, the war is in it,"" he writes - in reference to a formulation in the second paragraph, in which, however, Russia is not accused. But his superior is still optimistic about it: ""Well, so far, for optics."" 
>
>While the summit is now underway, the wrangling over the final declaration continues. In a version of the text that became known on Tuesday, the words ""war in Ukraine"" are written. However, there is no direct attribution of blame to Russia by summit participants. Only a mention of the UN General Assembly finds its way in, addressing Russian aggression. For Konstantin, his colleague and the Russian delegation, things could probably have gone worse.

The “accident” will allow them to know if  they can contemplate tactical nuclear weapons, their only chance of winning the war. It’s unlikely this was an accident, but even if it was, it has exactly the same effect.

Make no mistake, if nato fumbles this one the risk of nuclear conflict goes way, way up.

The response must be swift, proportionate, but strategically very expensive for Russia.

It needs to hurt bad enough to be just a little scary and remove any doubt as to the unified response of nato.  The future of humanity may very well depend on it.

Sanitizing Ukrainian airspace within reach of the NATO border, for example. Destroying any launchers capable of reaching NATO cities if they go active.  That would be a proportionate response.

The minimum response required to ensure that no more missiles can go into NATO airspace, since Russia apparently can’t ensure that on their own."

One. Maximizing terror. Air raid may mean one missile or a hundred.

Two. They wait for an infrastructure object to be rebuilt and then strike it again, eventually you'll run out of equipment and the material to rebuild.

Three. They really are running short on missiles."
