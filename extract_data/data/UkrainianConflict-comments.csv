The sanctions are an inconvenience.  Military parts are another story.  But unenforced sanctions mean that trade with Iran, and NK are perfectly fine."

The thing about Putin is that he tends to create decrees like this AFTER the event. This means he is probably already conscripting from forign countries."

1668484825.0,iwf3yco,t5_30hhs,0,1,Nabugu,0,What's great about it is that the money sent by the US to Ukraine is surely one of the most efficient in terms of geopolitical impact per dollar spent since decades. I understand why Biden want to send more lol.
1668484856.0,iwf40nu,t5_30hhs,0,1,Firm-Seaworthiness86,0,"I think it was an armistice not a peace treaty so basically the terroritorial changes during the conflict just stayed where they were, sort of frozen.

Take my opinions with a grain of salt. My knowledge of the conflict comes in the contexts of other conflicts (Soviet vs USA), WW1 history and WW2 history and American foreign policy. I've never actually read a book about this specific conflict. Mostly articles and videos.

My reading tends to be European history post 1789 to today."
