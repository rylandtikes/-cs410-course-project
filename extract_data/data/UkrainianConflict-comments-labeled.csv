What you confuse here, and also Mearsheimer does, is Putin's interests, and Russia's rational interests. They neither have to be identical nor they are. Putin was primarily scared of Ukraine ""leaning West"" (actually also not ""Ukraine"", but the population and government, and not about geopolitics, but about ideas and ideologies). The risk to his interests was that Ukraine, ""the small sister of Russia"", had the real chance to become a successful democratic part of the West. And that Russians would see that, and would ask, why can't we have the same democracy, freedom and prosperity, Ukraine probably had gotten with the extensive EU-AA in the course of a few years. With his attacked on Ukraine he limited that process much. His fear was not primarily of NATO, but of the EU, not even the real EU, but the fundamental ideas of the EU getting hold in Ukraine."

The vote never happened because of that, if it had happened, probably more than 50% of NATO had denied to support it. And only one veto is necessary that it doesn't happen.

Ukraine and Georgia were in 2008 extremely far from actually getting a MAP - Ukraine also because of internal politics, corruption and so on, not just the struggles with Russia. People often forget that short after Yanukovych got to power (and it was back then not unexpected, Ukraine was alternating between ""pro-Russian"" and ""pro-Western"" leaderships), and nobody would have wanted to have that guy in NATO. 

---

>NATO and Ukraine have been flirting since early 2000s. Russia got scared they were close in 2014 when the president was overthrown,

Ukraine was not close at that point. Ukraine was close to become a part of the West in particular culturally and in respect to democracy, civil society and removing corruption etc.. What Putin feared there, is his extreme fear of Color Revolutions, and Ukraine becoming an example for Russia, in particular after the 2012 protests in Russia still being fresh. This was not about a fear for Russia, but about him fearing about his power and the power of his system and his ideology in Russia.

Btw. just some years before, Putin gave a presser together with Kuchma, not being scared of NATO in Ukraine at all, but still more or less saying, we (Russia) decided to have just good relations with NATO and integrate to some degree, it is up to Ukraine to choose there own way and decide themselves how far they want to integrate.

This only changed more and more getting closer to 2008, and when Putin saw that NATO is very unhappy about things like the invasion of Georgia, and might actually be a hindrance to Russia establishing and controlling a ""sphere of influence"" again. Not because of threats against Russia, they had been the same already in 2002, when Putin was still friendly with NATO.

It was not NATO which changed after that and suddenly became a threat, it was Russia and in particular Putin who changed and became more and more aggressive with the ""near-abroad"", and NATO - as a defensive alliance also incorporating nations there, was an obstacle to that.

>so they annexed Crimea to create a land dispute (countries with land disputes are uneligable)

That is false - it makes it more difficult, but doesn't prevent it, if NATO actually wanted."

As to Russia's claims, Mearsheimer parrots exactly what Russia was saying before it invaded, as it poured troops up to the UA border.  Again, M's refusal to recognize the threat that Russia imposed as it chatted about its desire to see UA pacific and neutral is disgusting, nauseating, infuriating."

Hirohito's actual involvement was that of a man who knew what his country was doing was wrong, but he basically had no power to do much about it because the Japanese military had gone completely insane.

He decided to just stay quiet for fear of someone worse replacing him if he speaks out. And when it came time for peace, he was generally very regretful over Japan's behavior and was the first to start setting Japan down the path of pacifism.

Hirohito even dedicated the near entire upbringing of his son Akihito to making sure Akihito could reign as a figure of pacifism and diplomatic peace once Akihito became emperor. And Akihito did exactly that and is the main reason modern Japan is so thoroughly non-violent.

There's a lot of war criminals in Japan that got away with no trial at the end of WW2, but letting specifically Hirohito go free had a very large Return-on-Investment for maintaining international peace.

Hirohito's definitely got some complicity in him, but he was still far from the contrarian, spite-filled monsters Hitler was and Putin is."

Mearsheimer's realism is plain ignorant (and most realism is), it is intentionally disregarding the majority of the information we have, claiming that it is irrelevant. But just looking at the last 30 years, we see it is the most relevant part. 

This is not even about the ideological part - IR realism vs IR liberalism - it is about the analytical part. I never got the idea of analytical realism, it starts with a bunch of presumptions, which are obviously false for today (and i would say have been forever), which just come out of nowhere. I don't see how this could even be called scientific, this all starts with some pretty strong assumptions which are just set, and never demonstrated as correct. 

I think you are getting wrong that Mearsheimer is a ""crypto-fascist"". His ideology is based on his false analysis, and most of what he says is probably just caused by __intentional__ and __willful__ ignorance, not malice.

Let's take the main tenets:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_realism#Main_tenets

(1) is disputable, and it is actually two claims, and it was not like the big powers were actually the sole drivers of this conflict, but one could argue, that it was actually, on one side, not even a state actor at all, but the population of a middle or small power. The influence of the populations and groups with span over multiple nations are totally disregarded in the whole framework. Then there is the question of anarchy - this depends pretty much on how we define the term, I won't dig deeper into that.

(2) is largely correct.

(3) is problematic, because it starts again with the implicit notion, that states are actually actors which have intentions as such - not politicians, not groups inside states, not groups spanning over states, not the population. From my point of view, this statement as such doesn't even make sense, because it is not even possible to contribute ""intentions"" to a state - which is from my POV just plain stupid - an entity like a state is fundamentally unable to have intentionality. It is based on the old realist idea, that states are black-boxes, and as they are, and we anyway can't know what is going on inside, we just _intentionally_ disregard it and claim and presume they are coherent actors. I don't get how one could even get to such a crazy idea...

I also now and then say things like ""Russia"" wants - but I don't mean that literal - people like Mearsheimer do. Disregarding that e.g. ""Russia"" is an extremely complex system, which has no ""Will"" or ""Intention"" as such, but the demonstrated abstract ""Will"" is an effect of the complex inner workings and relations with the outer world.

(4) seems like a no-brainer, but it is not. This is more or less the old idea of realism, denying also that politics and ideology matter. And it also includes (5) already, that states are somehow rational actors. 

(5) this is again taking states as coherent actors, which is already an imho completely false notion (see above), but even claiming they act rational, and that in a particular framework and game and rules (those which realism also defines), what is obviously not the case. 

There is even much more critique about that, and even more about what is not there, and the focus on military means.

I'll stop that here. But tldr; - I think Mearsheimer deserves a much more fundamental attack, because not only his conclusions, which are well destructed by Continer are terrible, but already the whole theory, well, more ideology, he bases all of his analysis on, is just some ignorant BS."

I do think that Ukraine is concentrating on Killing and wounding Russians while preserving  thier own forces  and once they have killed or wounded enough the front collapsis and they move forward.

The fact is that speeches are just that - speeches. They depend on the audience. 

To get the underlying idea of Putin's goal one should take account the conflicts and resolvements of his entire career. Second Chechen War, Russo-Georgian War and now the war in Ukraine. NATO is just an excuse, the real problem is Ukraine's tendency to cooperate with Europe instead of Russia (applying for membership of NATO is the pinnacle of those tendencies - 28% of popular support for NATO in 2012 and 69% in 2017). Moreover, to get the whole picture, we should map all ""pro-Russia"" movements to get the idea of the possible agenda.

Also we should keep in mind that the conflict started not in 2022 but in 2014 when Little Green Men (aka Russian soldiers) entered eastern part of Ukraine and Crimea and started to escalate the conflict. I would even argue that the seeds of the conflict were laid when ""pro-Russia"" demonstrations broke out in some Ukraine areas (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014\_pro-Russian\_unrest\_in\_Ukraine). Interestingly, even in the Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk, there was no popular support for union with Russia (41.0% Crimea, 33.2% Donetsk Oblast, 24.1% Luhansk Oblast). After annexation of Crimea the results from a different poll show that majority of population did not want to be annexed by Russia (the combined percentage for the people opting for the options of ""Rather, no"" and ""Certainly, no, I don't"": 51.9% Luhansk Oblast, 52.2% Donetsk Oblast, 65.6% Kharkiv Oblast, 78.8% Odesa Oblast, 81.5% Zaporizhia Oblast, 84.1% Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, 84.6% Kherson Oblast, 85.4% Mykolayiv Oblast).

How did those ""pro-Russian"" protests appear when majority of population was not pro-Russia, we can currently only speculate. But since pro-European Euromaiden movement had been very popular, we can assume that generating unrest and pro-Russia movement would be in Russia's playbooks. (Instigation of local unrests are part of Russia's handbook of operations. Bronze-night in Estonia was organized by four instigators that got funded by Russian State Duma. Linter was later also part of DNR leadership: [https://www.stena.ee/blog/drug-putina-zyat-pushilina-kak-dmitrij-linter-%E2%80%94-chlen-estonskoj-bronzovoj-chetverki-%E2%80%94-voshel-v-](https://www.stena.ee/blog/drug-putina-zyat-pushilina-kak-dmitrij-linter-%E2%80%94-chlen-estonskoj-bronzovoj-chetverki-%E2%80%94-voshel-v-)).

Maybe you cannot call it traditional ""imperialism"" when you try to destabilize surrounding countries and keep your sphere of influence (from financing insurgets to threatening with conflict / starting a war), but it also is not explainable by ""threat from NATO"". Russian leaders know that NATO will never attack Russia by itself They choose to tell people otherwise."

This is correct, he showed hostility, was not surrendering, and as an active combatant, he was a valid legal target. The debate is about the others.

I can see they got accidentally shot, or in error, or _after_ what we see in video 1, they acted hostile - I think the first two are most likely what happened. That would all not (necessarily) be crimes of war. If they were intentionally engaged just because of a perceived threat or risk or even in retribution, it would legally be a crime.

>You are not covered by international law when you yourself are violating it.

That is largely also incorrect. That he committed perfidy, actually doesn't invalidate the protection, what does invalidate it, is that he just didn't fulfill the conditions for the protection outlined in article 41 of the additional protocol anymore, as he acted hostile. That his hostile acting was also perfidy, only means that he in addition also committed a crime of war.

Loses of protection in IHL happen only, like they are explained in the part of the IHL dealing with those protections.

---

From the videos it is impossible to conclude if a crime of war happened or not, a further investigation is needed for that.

What the ombudsman says there is false, targeted retaliatory fire again a person who surrendered and didn't show hostility again, is illegal. And that is about each individual person, it is irrelevant what others do. The IHL in those parts clearly doesn't speak about ""groups"" or ""they"", but about ""person"" and ""he"". 

The Additional Protocol is absolutely clear about that, you can never target hors-de-combat directly. But it might either be not a targeted engagement or not intented to shoot at hors-de-combat. If they are e.g. caught in the crossfire, and it is not feasible and proportional to act so, it is not illegal that they got hit engaging the military objective, the soldier who was behind them committing perfidy.

I won't claim to be an expert, but one lesson this war has repeatedly hammered home is that specialists don't grow on trees, and you can't take for granted that there will always be Some Guy ready to hire with an intimate understanding of hardware that's only used in one or two locations on earth. 

Same goes for oil refineries under sanctions, or Twitter under Musk. I'm by no means an engineer, so it's easy for me to just imagine these people just go to Computer School and come out with all the skills and knowledge to operate any piece of software in the world, but that's obviously not the case."

Ukraine did have problems sourcing Soviet artillery ammo early summer, when they were able to fire only 5000-6000 shells a day vs. the Russians firing up to 60,000 shells a day.  Thus the rush to equip Ukraine with all sorts of NATO artillery (M777, FH70, M109A3GN, CAESAR, PzH2000, Krab, Zuzanna 2, etc.) and to get Ukraine HIMARS so they could start hitting the Russian ammo depots."

You aren't using that logic correctly. You are basically advocating for them to give up and then get re invaded.  

They are working on a military defeat up to whatever they can get whether that's at the border or even if not.

After that, there will be a guarantee from others to protect the borders.   This will happen regardless whether its giving Russia all it wants now or not.  So obviously Ukraine will take back as much as they can and then work on that peace after.

Russia if left unchecked yes would want to keep invading Ukraine and next Moldova.  Russia was close to/inciting fear in Moldova back around may that they were going to invade.  The only reason that stopped is because Russia got bogged down.

The answer to the question u have is yes: military defeat.

Also what right now we see happening is Russia is on the verge of the begging stages of falling.  Not that it will, but this is definitely in the direction it's going.  So Ukraine is capitalizing on that with their military defeat.  Its basically like saying kick them while they are weak.  It's about taking any advantages along the way regarding weakening Russia that will make future aggression unlikely bc it takes time to get back the momentum they lost.  And in that time, its also possible that coupled with a weaker, more troubled Russia, there is a chance for Russia to change.  It's a very small chance but it's better than nothing.

To also sum it up: this is Ukraine's decision what they do with their country.  It's clear that right now there are people trapped in occupied zones and Ukraine has the upper hand and will work on freeing what it can  - until it can't. That's pretty much all you need to know."

I think this is exactly where Mearsheimer has made such a wrong turn.  We are in an unprecedented place in history where foreign leaders can easily speak freely to *foreign* audiences at will.

These are not weapons that are being repurposed. These are weapons that were designed purely to hard counter Soviet tech like a game of rock paper scissors that Russia quit keeping up with 40 years ago. Even if their equipment was all in pristine and well maintained condition, these weapons would still be devastating. Nobody seems to really mention the nature of these things being designed specifically with Russia in mind, but it clearly matters. 

That all being said, war is a short term kicking of the can, not a solution. The world pointing weapons at each other is no way to live, and we are still very much in the dark ages here. I can only hope that the post putin Russia is a little less venomous with it's intentions. Yeah, the west is corrupt and has a lot of problems. But a corrupt and horrible parallel is not the solution, especially not when it's even worse than the order it stands to counter. 

Humanity is in for a dark road ahead as the consequences of our unsustainable society start catching up to us more and more. This is the precious window of time that we should be spending working together to change and mitigate these unfolding disasters. Instead it's looking like a decade of tensions and war. 

It's just a terrible shame all the way around.

The Russian troops, retreating along a front of more than 600 miles, destroyed anything that might be of use to their enemy, including crops, houses, railways and entire cities. They also forcibly removed huge numbers of people."""

If you read my past comments on Xi, Ive said a lot. His country is imploding from within right now, the Chinese people are actually even rioting. However, he doesnt have his thumb quite firmly on them yet, thats coming. I think hes deliberately tanking his economy to move to a Planned Economy so that they can be as self-reliant as possible. He needs his country as self-reliant as possible, so that no one can use sanctions against him, so that the West cannot affect his behaviour, or control it. 

The US has banned the sale of advanced chips to China, but Xi needs them. How can he get them? Germany stopped the sale of the chip factory to China, Canada has ordered Chinese companies to divest themselves of stock in our mineswhere can he get the chips from, he needs them for his country. Where can he get them? He can get them from Taiwan of course. He has to try.

Xi was just offered the MRNA vaccine for his people again, and again he refused. Why? Hes shuttering mega cities, over and over and over again, businesses are going under daily, maybe even by the thousands. And with the real estate crash, people are losing all their hard-earned cash. I dont know if youve been watching whats been going on there, but it would blow your mind. Even Chinese people who are experiencing it cant believe what theyre up against. But I believe things are going to continue to get worse. He needs his county situated just right, and theyre not there yet.. Also, Xi cleared his cabinet now, he got rid of the other faction, its all his own yes men in power with him now. Now hes in the same echo chamber that putins in.

We absolutely cannot give in, I could be crazy, but I think things are about to get a lot worse. I dont believe any of them like each other, but to overcome the West, I wouldnt put it past some of the players to join together. We already know Iran has been helping Russia, now I hear Russia is just going to make their own Iranian drones. How will they do that? Whos helping them?

This is actually what Mearsheimer thinks too. The thing with Mearsheimer is he thinks the world becomes stable by having great powers that let each other have their spheres of influence. Mearsheimer believes that the best strategy of a state is to increase its relative power to the point of achieving regional domination by relying on offensive tactics. He thinks the Russian invasion is the natural, unavoidable consequence of Ukraine not submitting to Russia. This is what a lot of people who blame the western world for the war think.

I grew up worrying about Russia and nuclear annihilation. When I was in the Army it was the foe we fought war games against. Ukraine has shown the world that Russia is only a paper tiger and that whatever it was decades ago, it is only a shadow of its past. Think of all the threats that Russians have made already, to use nuclear weapons against NATO and Ukraine. The west was terrified to supply Ukraine with modern artillery and ammo. Only threats from Moscow. Now we send HIMARS, Patriot missiles, and other advanced equipment to Ukraine. So what does Russia do? Only more threats. They use threats, to the befuddlement of their populace, because their military has been looted for decades (1.5 million missing uniforms?!!) to the point that they are out of even the most basic items needed to maintain an army.

Give Ukraine main battle tanks, F-16s, and plane loads of Patriot missilesRussia can only make threats. They cant afford to lose their long feared nuclear deterrent by demonstrating its dilapidated and no longer works."

According to him, there is no need to be afraid of a reduction in US support for Ukraine. He noted that there is ""absolute freedom of speech"" in the USA.  
  
""We have 535 congressmen, and among that number there are some who do not support the US efforts to help Ukraine. They have the right to express that opinion, and when one of them makes such statements, journalists flock like flies to honey. write about it,"" said the senator.  
  
  
Rish said that it may even be about increasing the amount of aid to Ukraine. He emphasized that ""this is constantly being discussed"" and mentioned US President Joe Biden's proposal for a new aid package for Ukraine with a guaranteed amount of funding.  
  
""Some believe that there should be more money, some believe that there should be less. We will find a solution,"" the politician summed up.

Russian pilots weren't even volunteering for service in the Chinese air force like a  bizarro reincarnation of the Flying Tigers.

Being the pathological cheaters and low-lives that they are, the ""non-combatant"" Russians were straight up [rotating regular fighter squadrons of MiG-15s and their associated AAA units into Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64th_Fighter_Aviation_Corps) and merely repainting the planes with Chinese or North Korean markings with Russian personnel labelled [""commercial travellers""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union_in_the_Korean_War#Soviet_Pilots). The Russians were doing this because Stalin had lost patience with the low-skilled Chinese pilots who were getting tuned in dogfights. As u/yamomsfavedappt notes, the Russian commanders soon scrapped the idea of forcing their pilots to speak only in Korean or Mandarin with the help of cue cards when on the radio. [A lot of F-86 pilots heard ""*!!!*"" and other erudite Russian expressions in their headsets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union_in_the_Korean_War#Contemporary_awareness_of_Soviet_participation).

To put things in the Babylonian terms that Russians understand, it would be fantastic if the USAF were to do something similar and transfer fighter wings of F-16s or F-15s to Poland, Slovakia or Romania and then let them fly combat missions in Ukraine - of course with the rule that the planes be painted in Ukrainian markings and that the pilots try to use only Russian or Ukrainian on the radio. ;-)"

So the policy has to be that a full launch can never happen, no matter what.

Where's there's room for discussion is around the margins. What can we do to help Ukraine with engineering a situation where a Russian strategic launch is on the table? That's the fuzzy area we're in now, what ""crosses the line"" and what doesn't. 

Ironically, that's where the relative stability of Putin's regime and Russian support for Putin actually works against Putin.

Ukraine already has fighter jets and has been able to use them effectively to shoot down Russia jets.

The problem is Russia has really good air defenses (S300/400 and many many others). That limits the capability of any jets over the battlefield. Essentially, over the front lines, all jets will have to fight at low altitude to avoid radar. And that just means they won't be very effective because low altitude maneuvers are not good for CAS and are vulnerable to manpads. 

The only real advantage of getting western style jets (Gripen or F16 or F15) is that Ukraine would get some flexibility in attacking/defending themselves. Additionally, they'd get supplied weapons by NATO instead of trying to find them from Eastern block countries. 

It's hardly a game changer. The truth is that Ukraine/Russia are mostly stuck in a ground war with limited use of UAVs."

Anyone can buy e.g. STM32F103 modules on AliExpress for a few bucks. Not anyone can field a development team that can use these chips to actually create a usable product or (in this case) weapons system.

The times where a single ""rockstar"" programmer can build a usable product are for the most part gone, systems have become complex, testing is expensive, and you need a team and support tools to create something sellable.

Secondly, a team of 8 (it might be 6, I can't remember) people can achieve all this with only one of them qualified to supervise the other 7 (or 5?) , who do not need to be qualified at all. Thirdly, all the equipment to support road base ops can be loaded into x2 half-size shipping containers that are already loaded onto trucks and are already to be transported and deployed.

Everything goes to the fact that the Kremlin will transfer control over the Zaporizhzhya NPP to the IAEA and then to Kyiv. The road map will be signed by the head of the IAEA, an Argentinean and a friend of the Pope, Rafael Grossi.  
Moscow considers the conditions of Zelensky / Grossi / Francis acceptable, any agreements with him are legitimate, no matter what the speaker of the Duma Volodin says.

This is the translation , I make no claim other than I translated the twitter post.

sounds odd at least, although it does explain the blowing up of the equpment need to generate the power. even more due to their original intention to connect it to the ru grid and power Crimea with it. maybe some back room threats went on and told if you do that rosatom gets sanctioned. still lets wait and see."

F-16s need a more sophisticated maintenance and logistics network, and thus have a larger operational footprint than even the Migs or Sukhois the Ukrainians are using. They're not as rugged and need longer runways and well trained personnel. Perhaps Ukraine has been secretly training crews on operating these aircraft, but if they haven't they it'll be many months before they are even remotely capable of effectively fielding and sustaining them.  

Gripens have a smaller footprint, but there just aren't enough of them laying around to be gifted to Ukraine as the F-16. In either case, the transition from Warsaw Pact fighters to NATO/Western ones will take a while, and proper and effective training CANNOT be understated. If you start throwing F-16s at Ukraine, you first need to properly set out the logistics footprint."

* Instant torque for rapid acceleration from a stop (great for shoot & scoot)
* High power to volume/mass
* Easy to service
* Low vibration
* Fuel flexibility
* Less heat to dissipate

To expand on the last point, a turbine dumps most heat into exhaust gasses while a diesel absorbs about 1/3rd of the heat produced which then has to be radiated away.

The biggest downside to a turbine is the high fuel consumption when idle, which is something the US is able to cope relatively well with due to already possessing the logistics to move large amounts of fuel for the even thirstier turbine aircraft it operates."

However, the Turkey has been drifting away from EU and the West in last decade. They don't really see any particular reason to act nice. The Turkish economy is in pretty bad spot with the worst inflation rate in Europe, and cutting access to cheap Russian goods would make their economical situation even worse. Weak and isolated Russia would be perfect for Turkey - cheap oil for a long time and free reign over Syria. Erdogan also wants to show that they are independent player and won't do something just because the West wants them to do. As long as the war continues, they have a lot of influence both in NATO and in the world.

On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron held a telephone conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyi against the backdrop of new shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.  
  
He said this during a speech in Paris at an international conference in support of Moldova, reports Censor.NET with reference to "" European Pravda "".  
  
""With every military victory of Ukraine, the recapture of Kharkiv region, as well as the return of Kherson, Russia reacts with new attacks on the most important infrastructure of Ukraine,"" Macron said.  
  
  
On Sunday, the French president held talks with IAEA Director General Raphael Grossi about the situation with the Zaporizhzhia power plant.  
  
The IAEA called the enemy shelling of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant on November 19 and 20 one of the most intense.

Everything goes to the fact that the Kremlin will transfer control over the Zaporizhzhya NPP to the IAEA and then to Kyiv. The road map will be signed by the head of the IAEA, an Argentinean and a friend of the Pope, Rafael Grossi.  
Moscow considers the conditions of Zelensky / Grossi / Francis acceptable, any agreements with him are legitimate, no matter what the speaker of the Duma Volodin says.  
The president will work according to the formula of holding power, so the cancellation of Kyiv's demand for the departure of Vladimir Putin from the Kremlin was a mirror response to the lack of desire to overthrow the Zelensky regime.  
The reality of the threat of an offensive by the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Crimea in the spring of 2023 created unacceptable domestic political risks for the Kremlin - TOGETHER with the inevitable second wave of mobilization in the event of such an offensive. Therefore, a derivative of the new agreements is tightening the screws on the critics of the NWO, who may not like the withdrawal from Energodar.  
The process of making new and new ""difficult decisions"" (in fact, without quotes), launched at the Security Council, has been launched. Before the New Year, the country is waiting for the most unexpected political upheavals and upheavals that, at best, will lead to insight.

>It looks like most of them were shot in the head, Dr. Rohini Haar, medical adviser at Physicians for Human Rights, said in an interview. There are pools of blood. That indicates that they were just left there dead. There appears to have been no effort to pick them up or help them.


>Dr. Haar noted that when they surrendered, the Russian soldiers had been lying down, apparently unarmed, with their arms outstretched or behind their heads. Theyre considered hors de combat, or noncombatants  effectively prisoners of war, Dr. Haar said.

...

>The Rome Statute, the international treaty that established the International Criminal Court, could prosecute this under several of its articles if Ukraine were a party to the treaty, Dr. Haar said, including Article 8b (vi), which says, Killing or wounding a combatant, who, having laid down his arms or having no longer means of defense, has surrendered at discretion is a violation of the laws of international armed conflict.


>Iva Vukusic, a war crimes prosecution expert at Utrecht University, said that it was difficult to determine whether  a war crime had or had not been committed based on the video evidence alone, and that the critical factor was time  when the Russians were shot.
Was it in one or two bursts of fire at the moment of, or immediately after, the last Russian comes out and shoots at the Ukrainians? Dr. Vukusic said. Or was it after the immediate threat had been neutralized, as an act of revenge  then this is more clearly a war crime.
If the Russians were shot in the heat of the moment, Dr. Vukusic said, it is not clearly a crime.
If these P.O.W.s were not searched yet, then the Ukrainians dont know if theyre armed, even if they are on the ground.


>The Russian gunmans actions are critical, too, Dr. Vukusic said, and could be deemed perfidy  feigning surrender or noncombatant status as a ruse against the Ukrainians  which may be prosecutable as a war crime under the Geneva Conventions.

>It may very well be that, had this guy not fired, that they all would have been captured as P.O.W.s, and survived, Dr. Vukusic added."

In the context of war, perfidy is a form of deception in which one side promises to act in good faith (such as by raising a flag of truce) with the intention of breaking that promise once the unsuspecting enemy is exposed (such as by coming out of cover to take the ""surrendering"" prisoners into custody).

Perfidy constitutes a breach of the recognized laws of war and so is considered a war crime, as it degrades the protections and mutual restraints developed in the interest of all parties, combatants and civilians.

> Ukraine is to evacuate civilians from recently liberated areas of the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions, amid fears that the damage to infrastructure caused by the war is too severe for people to endure the winter.

> The evacuations come just over a week after Ukraine retook the city of Kherson - which remains close to the frontline - and areas around it.

> The liberation marked a major battlefield gain, while the evacuations highlight the difficulties Ukraine is facing after heavy Russian shelling of its power infrastructure as winter sets in.

I also have no sympathy for russian soldiers or pro-russians anymore. But this talk of ""russians are mongols at heart thus subhuman"" is ridiculous & has to stop. 

It is historically true that the modern state of Russia is founded in Muscovy which grew to power as a vassal city-state to the mongol empire. The circumstances of Muscovy's adoption of extreme authoritarianism as a standard govt is based on adopting the POLITICAL CULTURE of the long-past mongol empire, NOT anything like ""asian heritage"" or ""asian genetics"". 

1. Being ""asian"" has nothing to do with any virtues or flaws to begin with, its just geographical in origin. Thinking that any one physical trait makes one inferior or superior is just bigoted & lazy thinking. 
2. It's even disingenuous to claim that Russia is definitively ""more asian"" while the rest of east europe is not at all asian-influenced. Going back in time, the modern ""borders"" of east europe & west asia were not well defined. Take for example: Ukraine's historical position as a gateway between ""east"" & ""west"" that once connected the Silk Road, Hungarians' & Estonians' & Finnish languages sharing a common language ancestor with modern-day Siberian languages suggesting they may have migrated from Siberia thousands of years ago, Turkey's long history of being a meeting place of many peoples from scandinavian to greek to turkic, Georgia while not widely considered ""european"" anymore has a long shared history with the rest of Europe.  
3. American skin-color-centric worldviews & Eurocentrism do not help, nor do they apply to much of eastern europe. The world is not neatly divided by ""colors"" in Eurasia because centuries-old ethnicities continue to exist which predate the west european colonizers' idea of dividing people into ""races"" by skin tone. And eurocentrism does not equally apply to east europe because east europeans are often looked down on by west europeans for being ""lesser"" in some way.
4. All this is insulting to Ukraine's various eastern allies including but not limited to: Kazakhs & modern Mongols who support Ukraine in small ways, Japanese & South Koreans & Taiwanese that materially support Ukraine's war effort.
5. It is an insult to the preexisting Korean minority community of Ukraine that has been & remains strongly anti-russian (see Mykolaiv's Vitaly Kim)."

When you have declining military might. You maintain a facade of things that work.

They have (had) the ability to project power in conflicts, like in Syria.

They invaded Ukraine with real military and real armor, real mistakes, and very real tanks. It wasnt merely plywood and cardboard and stating it that way is not fair to characterizing the fight the Ukrainian people have had to endure this year. 

What they didnt account for was they expected the western world to be fractured, they expected Germany to be too scared of losing their gas supply, they didnt expect advanced weapons from outside as much as Ukraine has got, and they didnt expect the actual resolve of the people of Ukraine and their leadership to fight this off through the worse of it. 

If thats truly your argument, realize Russia had a very real invasion force and is currently sitting on 20% of Ukraines land.

Yes, theyre losing ground, but not without hard fights over long periods of time and very real missiles striking Ukrainian cities in ways we can only amount to falling it war crimes.

According to US Congress Senator Jim Risch, a Republican, he himself supports the provision of Western-model fighter jets to Ukraine, but there is still no majority for this step among members of Congress.  
  
Rish said this in an interview with ""European Pravda"" on the sidelines of the Halifax Security Forum, where he arrived at the head of the delegation of the American Congress, Censor.NET reports .  
  
He noted that air control is necessary for Ukraine to win the war.  
  
"" I probably represent the most determined group ( in the U.S. Congress ) . In particular, I think it's important to give Ukraine fighter jets and train your pilots. Some people say, ""Oh no, this will lead to escalation."" But listen, when we fought in Vietnam and Korea, the Russians have supplied both planes and pilots to our adversaries! It is time for the US to reciprocate. I am absolutely ready to vote for such a move. I have met with Ukrainian pilots and believe they can use the F- 16. Yes, some training is required, but there are no major problems,"" noted Jim Risch.  
  
  
At the same time, he admitted that there is no support from the majority for such a decision, as for the provision of Patriot complexes.  
  
""Therefore, for the near term, I advise you to work on the next step being to provide more NASAMS. These systems have proven effective in closing the skies. With enough of them, it will be possible to essentially close the skies without using fighters. Use NASAMS, and in addition, the Stingers, which have already proven themselves quite well as an aid in closing the sky,"" noted Jim Rish.

This article will continue on the topic of nuclear weapons that was addressed in the previous article. This time, instead of talking about using nuclear weapons, well talk about the mere prospect of their use and the purpose behind threats to that effect.

The Clausewitzian lens is particularly appropriate for this subject because of the area between peace and war in which threats fall into. Clausewitz defines war as the use of violence for political ends. A threat is not war, but it is the leveraging of potential violence for political gain. The threat is at the core of Clausewitzs concept of war. It is as much the threat of future violence as the actual violence of war that forms its ability to shape policy. A state is likely to make peace when it is militarily defeated because of the threat, implicit or explicit, of what will happen if it does not. The threat of violence is not war, but a threat is a clear illustration

of the manner in which force serves as a currency for policy.

When Russian state media glorifies murder of millions of Westerners by nuclear fire, the intermingling of force and politics is shown in stark relief. The promise of extreme violence is on display as a tool to persuade and dissuade. This use of rhetoric is significant because Russia possesses the capabilities to make good on these threats, almost instantaneously if it chooses to. The threat of universal suicide is not credible, but the mere possibility of something so horrendous gives it political weight nonetheless.

Given the Russians have no intention of waging a nuclear war, why do they so frequently threaten it? To answer that question, we must first ask ourselves what the effects of these threats are on Russias adversaries. Even if theres no realistic chance that anyone would be suicidal enough to start a nuclear war, the fact that such a thing is possible is enough to cause considerable consternation among the public in any confrontation between nuclear power. This is true even if neither regime has raised the specter of nuclear war. Voices in media and academia inevitably urge restraint and mediation, and this has an effect on the public, forcing a government to expend political capital to remain engaged in the confrontation.

It is this pressure that is the core of the strategic logic behind nuclear saber rattling. By increasing the salience of nuclear weapons in the public consciousness, one power can test the resolve of the other.  The mechanism for this is the increasing of the political costs for maintaining engagement in the confrontation. This is a rare arena in which authoritarian regimes possess the advantage relative to open societies. Russia, with its tightly controlled media environment and culture of political apathy, can expect little domestic reaction to its stoking of nuclear tensions. The open societies of the West must reckon with public opinion directly, and therefore pay a far higher toll when the prospect of nuclear use is raised in a confrontation.

This imbalance creates a powerful incentive for authoritarian powers to engage in nuclear saber-rattling. By intimating the willingness to use nuclear weapons, Russia can increase the pressure on Western governments to disengage from Ukraine. Russia has little reason to refrain from making nuclear threats. The Putin regime is insulated from public opinion. In fact, saber-rattling plays to the kind of great power nostalgia that supports Putins popularity in Russia. As such, emphasizing Russias indelible status as a nuclear power can strengthen the regimes credibility among nationalists, a much needed prospect as defeats on the battlefield weaken Putins support in that quarter.

Crucially, nuclear rhetoric is not a form of escalation. Russia has not actually changed its nuclear posture or made any kind of move that would challenge the West to respond in kind. At the same time Russian statements on nuclear use are generating doomsday-filled headlines, senior Russian officials are meeting with their American counterparts to defuse tensions. Consequently, Russian saber-rattling is no more than propaganda, an effort to increase the salience of the risks of supporting Ukraine. It is a deliberate effort to add substance to arguments that Western support for Ukraine is simply too risky to be justified. Fundamentally, its an attempt to directly engage the Western public and use public opinion to pressure Western governments into disengagement.

Russia could pressure the Wests governments directly via escalation, but that is an inherently risky prospect. It is dangerous from a Russian perspective, of course, because of the clear consequences if escalation gets out of hand. All parties are equally aware that a nuclear exchange must be avoided at all costs. Beyond the potential for annihilation at the end of the escalation ladder, Russia faces the problem that any escalation is more likely to deeply embroil the West in the conflict. In the simplest terms, Russias hope is that the West will lose interest in Ukraine. Escalating the situation makes that impossible. Creating a nuclear crisis makes the situation in Ukraine more relevant to the West and therefore makes the West less likely to exhaust its strategic patience. For this reason, Russia has confined its behavior to nuclear threats, without actual changes to its nuclear posture.

Nuclear saber-rattling therefore fits into a larger Russian strategy of attempting to encourage the West to disengage from Ukraine, on account of both the risks and financial costs. If the West remains firm in its backing of Ukraine, the balance of force will continually edge further away from Russia. A Russian victory-or even stalemate-is contingent on successful attritional warfare. Because of the Wests overwhelming economic advantage, Russian strategy must be based on exhausting the Wests strategic patience in order to gain a relative advantage in Ukraine. Raising the prospect of nuclear war provides ammunition to domestic forces that favor appeasement and isolation and increases the costs to remain engaged. Nuclear rhetoric therefore becomes a costless method by which Russia may exert pressure on the West, without assuming the risks that actual nuclear escalation would entail."

No, they start with ""We really like <insert military branch of choice of your country>, could you send us some more promotional material?""

This establishes a personal connection between the potential spy and the handler. Then, the requests will progress to include more and more material that is technically unclassified, so the target doesn't really have a reason to reject the requests, but it becomes more and more obscure to source, and is possibly paid for by token amounts.

Then, at some point, the target is compromised, simply by mildly threatening to expose the amount of information transfer, and being asked the question ""Why are you working for the Russians?"" by the superiors.

They told us this in basic training in cold-war days. Any request from anyone for publicly available material should be responded by directing them to the public relations office. This guy was an officer, he was either stupid, or actually wanting to become a spy. Good riddance."

Essentially, Russia pays no political price for nuclear saber-rattling and therefore find it a cheap way of driving up the political costs for western nations to remain engaged in Ukraine. Raising the specter of nuclear war provides ammunition for isolationist forces in Western politics to press for the abandonment of Ukraine. Because of the economic imbalance between Russia and the West, Russia's hopes for victory in Ukraine are based on a strategy of engineering Western disengagement from the conflict. Nuclear threats can therefore be seen most accurately as an element of this strategy."

Russia used to be the dominant player at Chinas biennial air show. However, at the recent 14th China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition, Russia kept a low profile, and its two air show teams were absent this year. Moreover, a Russian defense company showed a publicity film in which a Russian military plane blew up a Chinese warship.  
  
The six-day exhibition, which kicked off on Nov. 8 in Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, attracted public attention amid the ongoing Russian-Ukraine war.  
  
State-run media Global Times reported on Nov. 10 that the booth of Rosoboronexportthe only state organization in Russia that exports the entire range of military, dual-use products, services, and technologieswas much smaller than before, which had a video display to showcase the Russian developed Su-57E stealth fighter, Su-35 super maneuverable fighter, Su-34E fighter-bomber, etc.  
  
The Russian Knights and Swifts aerobatic demonstration team of the Russian air force, which used to be the most eye-catching performers at the Zhuhai air show, did not participate this year. Chinas Peoples Liberation Army air force was the only flight demonstration performer at the show.  
  
At the 11th Zhuhai air show in 2016, Russia had a larger presence. Chinese state media made a big fanfare even before the air show began on Nov. 1 that year.  
  
According to Chinas Xinhua News Agency, 49 Russian defense industry and dual-use companies participated in the show, with more than 220 pieces of military equipment on display.

The Russian Knights aerobatic demonstration team, formed in April 1991, made its first trip to China at the countrys second air show in 1998 and has since participated in 2000, 2006, 2012, 2014, and 2016. The Swifts aerobatic demonstration team, formed in May 1991, has joined the Knights in Chinas airshow since 2004.  
  
The two teams had a mixed formation show at the 2016 Zhuhai air show, their first one outside Russia.  
  
Analyst: Russian Air Force Damaged in Ukraine War  
U.S.-based Chinese current affairs commentator Chen Baokong analyzed the reasons behind Russias low-key participation in his YouTube program on Nov. 13.  
  
He said the international community ridiculed Russias fighter planes and air force strength because of their poor performance in the Ukraine war. Therefore, Russia did not have the confidence it had before to show off its military strength at Chinas air show.  
  
Russian fighter planes were exterminated in large numbers by Ukraine forces, so Russia feels humiliated, Chen said. Moreover, Russias air force has been struggling on the Ukraine battlefield; it certainly does not have the capacity to participate in the Zhuhai air show. In other words, the actual reason behind Russias low-profile participation in the air show is that it was hit hard in the Russo-Ukrainian War.  
  
Chinas air force showed off its J-16 and J-20 stealth fighter jets. Some analysts commented that this indicates China is surpassing Russia in military strength.  
  
However, Chen pointed out that in the past, the Chinese regime was reluctant to showcase its military aircraft because its J-16 fighter is an imitation of Russias Su-30 fighter. China was afraid of getting into intellectual property disputes with Russian engineers, he said.  
  
Video: Russian Plane Bombs Chinese Warship  
In a video shown by the Russian exhibitor at the Zhuhai air show, a Russian-made MiG-29 fighter jet launched an anti-ship missile attack on a Chinese warship, which instantly burst into flames.  
  
A Chinese online military media outlet commented on the video, At first glance, it was just an ordinary computer-generated publicity video, but when you take a closer look at the bombed enemy ship, why does it look so familiar? It turned out that the warship being bombed was Chinas 052D destroyer.  
  
This scene is too awkward indeed. After all, China and Russia \[are\] strategic partners, the article said.  
  
The author claimed that India was involved in the film. Some say  the Russian exhibitor outsourced the publicity filmmaking to an Indian company. In other words, the Indian side deliberately replaced the target ship of the Russian fighter jet attack with a China-made warship.  
  
However, the Indian newspaper Eurasia Times denied the claim in a Nov. 11 report, saying that the scene in the video was a mistake made by the Russian exhibitor and had nothing to do with India.  
  
In this regard, Chen commented that it was impossible that the Russian company did not review the promotional video before the exhibition.  
  
But here is what Russia means, he said. Russia has made it clear in the film that the real enemy it wants to destroy is the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese Communist Party claims its 052D is a first-class warship, but Moscow implies it is no match for the Russian war effort.  
  
According to Chen, Russia deliberately played the video at the air show to send the Chinese regime a message: first, Russia is not happy with China copying its technology; second, Russia is letting the international community know that its real enemy is not the United States or Ukraine, but the Chinese Communist Party."

In particular, on the proposal of the Director General of the IAEA, Raphael Grossi, to conduct an assessment of the damage at the Zaporizhzhia NPP, the adviser to the Director General of ""Rosenergoatom"", Renat Karchaa, said in a comment to rosZMI: ""If they want to check an object that has nothing to do with nuclear safety, access will be denied "", reports Censor.NET with reference to Ukrainian Pravda .  
  
At the same time, ""Energoatom"" notes that Russia is trying to blame Ukraine for the shelling: ""Just when the occupiers themselves and their henchmen do not allow the experts of the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect the destruction, thus hiding the evidence of their crimes.""  
  
Citing information provided by the management of the ZNPP, the IAEA team at the scene reported that the damaged infrastructure includes a building for the storage of radioactive waste, cooling water systems, a cable to one of the reactors, a bridge to another reactor and auxiliary buildings.

It is entirely possible Putin has been able to maintain a fair fraction of his nukes, despite the corruption and false reports that have reduced his conventional forces without his knowledge. If he gave the nukes enough personal attention, they might be in good shape.

When Putin took over ~in 2000, he ordered a status report on the nukes as one of his first acts. Between 10% and 20% were operational at that time, mostly due to poor maintenance. Silos were found that were completely flooded, full of water to the top, that had been listed as ""ready to fire."" Every other kind of neglect, missing parts, and falsification of records was also revealed.

Putin did spend a good deal, restoring silos and submarines to operational status, but 22 years have passed. Unless he has kept his personal eye on these forces, records have been falsified and parts sold, to enrich local commanders. All indications are that corruption is worse in the Russian military today than it was in 2000. I doubt Putin himself has anything like a precise idea of how many working nukes he has. But ...

Whether Putin has 20 or 400 working nukes, that is enough to cause real deterrence in the West. Deterrence works whether backed by real strength, or by a sufficiently convincing bluff.

In 1949 (?) when the Russians set off their first atom bomb, President Truman asked for a report on the status of American nuclear forces. The report was prepared with blanks for the numbers, which were only given verbally. I believe those numbers were later revealed to be:

 - Number of working atom bombs = 0
 - Number of working atom bombs in 2 weeks = 4
 - Number of working atom bombs in 2 months = 4 
 - Number of working atom bombs in 6 months = (I do not know this number. I believe it was an increase to something between 8 and 20.)

Needless to say, these numbers were highly secret until the 1970s. All 4 of the available bombs were of the Nagasaki type. The US immediately started a program to build more and bigger bombs, culminating in the original Hydrogen bomb, or ""Super."" At the same time, a much smaller program to build the smallest possible bomb, using a minimum of plutonium or uranium, was started."

His mandate did _not_ extend to prosecution sitting members of congress, although he should been able to the goods on 10 or 20 of them. His investigation was limited to the Trump campaign, ignored the rest of Trump finances. It went after the relative outsiders who were in the Trump campaign like Manafort, while ignoring the wider corruption in Congress, people like Devin Nunes.

It was estimated back in 2016 that Putin had bought the influence he had for about the cost of an F-35 fighter jet, maybe $150 million. I find that number unconvincing. From other sources the total amount of illegal campaign contributions going into the Republican Party in 2016 was about $3 billion. I find that number convincing.

$3 billion is a lot less than the US is pumping into the Ukraine War in a week, these days. (Most of that is spent at aerospace factories, and it's doing the US economy a lot of good, but never mind that.) I don't know what the Russians are spending on the Ukraine War, but between sanctions, lost oil/gas revenue, expenditures for arms, insurance payouts, etc., it could be costing Russia $3 billion in a week or a month. Buying the American elections looks very cheap by comparison.

If Trump had won in 2000, he would have withdrawn the US from NATO and given Russia support instead. Everything would have been very different by now..."

In the USA the pro-Russian party just won the House, which means Biden's abilities to support Ukraine are extremely hampered.

In 2024 Trump is expected to win, who has shown himself very pro-Putin, absurdly so.

The Swiss's internal politics are anti-Ukraine for a variety of complex reasons.

The eastern EU nations, ignoring Hungary, and pro-Ukraine but generally have low resources, or can't just fund the UA on their own.

Western EU nations are already talking about Ukraine fatigue, costs, and peace settlements. Germany never truly supported Ukraine past a basic level, France wants a settlement immediatly, and Spain has limited arms, and the UK's new Tory minister may or may not change course.

So who is going to supply Ukraine now? During a recession with Putin talking nukes constantly? Worse, Russia still has a powerful economy and can make arms and arm soldiers non-stop for years, if not decades. Is Europe going to bet against this? Are they ready to support Ukraine for many years of warfare?

SO yes its easy to resupply them, and they should, but global politics is moving rightward towards fascism and oligarchy and against democracy in nearly all Western nations. The political will to keep fighting this war doesn't look good for Ukraine right now thanks to some recent elections. Lets face it, if it wasn't for Biden, Ukraine would have already settled a peace with Russia. Ukraine's support is a lot more limited and fragile than you seem to think it is."

Initially there might have been some merit to it - but Ukraine has proven it can:

\- protect valuable weapons systems when they're given to it & not lose them e.g HIMARS

\- follow rules given to them as to the usage of weapons systems (even if these rules are somewhat unfair) e.g told by US not to use HIMARS to launch directly into Russia itself)

\- has proven it's prowess on the battlefield and that it is no pushover, where any aid is wasted

\- is overwhelming abiding by the Geneva Convention and Intl Law - so will not embarrass donors by using weapons to kill civilians (cough cough - like Russia!)

It's like many Western countries are trying to barely give Ukraine enough weapons to squeak out a victory or stalemate.  Most of the weapons the West has WERE SPECIFICALLY BUILT TO DEFEAT RUSSIA - so why not give them to Ukraine a lil rapider?

The longer this shit drags on it only advantages Russia - as he's counting on Western nations losing interests/Govt changes etc - he'd have liked to have won in 3 days but will be very happy if it takes 3 yrs. We need to give UA what they need, stop dragging our feet on it."

There are more important things on the agenda.  
Supporting Ukraine and weaken Russia both to a maximum.

In this case, the process of arriving at this estimate seems pretty simple. The original number of 2000 was probably given out by Russia, either to show their strength, or because of treaty obligations, like their statements about how many tanks they had.

The number 120 is no doubt based in part on the number of missiles fired. Based on range and explosive power, and sometimes on fragments with identifying marks, Ukraine and the US agencies can make pretty good estimates.

Estimates of continuing production of new missiles in Russia would be made in part based on production figures from before the war, modified by a rise if it is thought Russia can ramp up production, or a drop in sanctions are thought to be effective. If sanctions have been effective, then production depends on components scavenged from dishwashers, toys, phones, etc.

Both Ukrainian and US intelligence would be likely to release a low estimate, to show Ukraine is winning but the war is not yet won. Also, the fact that Russia is now using their missiles sporadically is an indication they are starting to run out."

This led India to isolate itself until the 1990s but also made India keep good relations with Russia. India has imported many Russian weapons as a way to meet ends before having an all Indian MIC. Do I think India is acting rationally? Kinda. They are buying oil from someone they trust, but I also think India is acting a bit irrationally.

This isn't about what any individual person would do. That's not how the spirit of a nation is measured. It's in the people as a whole.

As of now, the Russian people are nowhere near passing that test, even when their government is slaughtering their neighbors. 

2)  The Russian government has been literally grabbing men from their homes and their jobs to ship them off to die as canon fodder, yet is stupid enough to put a gun in someone's hands seconds after sentencing them to death. 

The government is extremely disorganized, corrupt, disloyal, inefficient, poses an imminent physical threat to hundreds of thousands of men regardless of political affiliation, and worst of all, appears weak.

 Could India Help Broker Peace in Ukraine?
 India has good relations with both Russia and the West, and seeks a more muscular role in geopolitics. The biggest obstacle is that Ukrainians and Russians dont want to talk.

 In July, when a critical deal was brokered by the United Nations and Turkey to free up millions of pounds of desperately needed Ukrainian grain, India played an important behind-the-scenes role in helping sell the plan to Russia, which had been blockading the grain ships.

 Two months later, when Russian forces were shelling the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine, leaving the world anxious about a nuclear catastrophe, India stepped in again and asked Russia to back off.

 Throughout the Ukraine war, India has quietly assisted during a few pivotal moments like these. This week, Indias foreign minister is traveling to Moscow for meetings with Russian officials on economic and political issues. Diplomats and foreign-policy experts are watching closely to see if India can use its unique leverage as one of the worlds largest countries that is a friend to both East and West to press Russia to end its war in Ukraine."

With a wounded man to take care of, it's not safe for the outnumbered Ukrainians to accept the Russians surrender, as they are going to be busy with their wounded guy, which would involve taking their hands off their weapons.

In that scenario (and in others) executing the Russians was probably not illegal or a war crime. Even if it sucks for everyone involved."

The truth is, we dont know exactly how it all went down, but what we do know is that while the Russians were surrendering, one f***ing Russian decided to run out with a machine gun and opened fire on the Ukrainians. The video doesnt show executions. In fact, what it seems to show is that all hell broke loose when the Russian open fired. I suspect that when this happened, the Ukrainian soldiers considered every Russian a combatant at that point and just started spraying. If the Ukrainians eliminated the armed Russian and then proceeded to execute the remaining Russians one by one, then we,ve got ourselves a war crime. But theres no evidence that this is what took place. Again, it sucks, but if we can just get real for a minute, I only saw one war crime committed in the video, and it was perfidy (An act of deception in which one side promises to act in good faith with the intention of breaking that promise once the unsuspecting enemy is exposed).

Putin's annexation meant that areas that weren't even under Russian control, and areas where they were being pushed back were now _also_ formally part of Russia just as much as Crimea was. So much for Russia's inviolable borders. Retreating from Kherson and then pretending nothing much happened and it didn't really matter just added further insult to injury.

But what they were was surrendered combatants, not yet searched in a setting in which their buddy just proved he possessed a murderous weapon.  What's to say the UA fighters did not expect that any one or more of the men on the ground was hiding a hand grenade or two?  Only Russian idiots would stand nearby to search men like that in any close quarter.  Only Russia thinks that while it snips testicles, these 2 men, that's 2 covering 6 or 8, could make this situation safe?  Maybe asking each man to stand up and strip off all their clothes, to stand naked, to verify they were weapon free would have been snippy's approach, as in BullShit, would have been the best choice.

2. As someone else noted, none of the Russians on the ground have yet been searched and one of them was looking at the doorway. This looks like it was planned by at least 2 of the Russians, in hindsight.
3. Also going by the red bands on their legs I would guess these are LPR/DPR Militia and not regular Russian infantry. But some of these militia are hardcore and include Nationalist volunteers from Russia. The UDF troops would know this.

I have worked with so called ""dormant"" accounts at UBS before and I know the exact rules and how they were created and in which timeline.  

____

First of all they claim that numbered accounts aren't truly anonymous. This is a lie! The source they link to is a document from 2011 about client identification at UBS. This document was created **after** the scandal to prevent future scandals and has nothing to do how numbered relations were handled in the 1940s or before. Before electronic records a numbered account *could* be completely anonymous if the client wanted it. The name of numbered accounts internally at UBS is ""Countremarque"" the french word for counter mark even if you google this you won't find much I guess nobody ever bothered to explain this to the public but basically numbered accounts (before electronic records) worked like this:  

* The bank creates a number for you and all records simply refer to this number instead of your name (hence the name numbered account). 

* You in return get something that identifies you as the ultimate beneficiary of the account / the owner (hence the name counter mark). 

Basically the same as safe deposit boxes where the bank would have one key and the client would have the other one.
Normally the client advisor **and only** the client advisor would also have a record of your name linking it to the account but technically speaking this was not required or if your client advisor would quit / die the information would die with him. Of course most clients would be in contact with their client advisor and make sure their mandate would be taken over but for people who died in WW2 or the holocaust this wasn't the case.

____

Now that this is out of the way let's talk about the dilemma of how the scandal happened and why I think it came to light / why everyone to this day is still talking about it. First of all, UBS didn't simply pay back the money they ""stole"" (stealing isn't the right word in my opinion but I will get to it later) in their settlement they paid about 40 times (!!!) the amount of the money in these dormant accounts and even if you factor in inflation and no they did not pay it to the actual descendants of the accounts but to a group representing ""holocaust victims"" in general so the people who benefited from this settlement were very likely not even descendants of the ""victims"" (I also have a problem with calling them that and will explain why later). It's also funny that it is never mentioned what the amount was. The amount on these dormant accounts was about 24 million Swiss Francs in 1999 (roughly 1:1 in USD nowadays back then way less).  

Okay I already explained how numbered accounts work in the first part of my comment now let's talk about how the rules are nowadays and work our way back.  

Have you ever thought about how the bank would know that you died?  
What if they had no way of contacting you?  
Have you ever thought about how your descendants would know that you have a bank account?  
What if you didn't have a single piece of paper linking you to the account in your documents?  

First of all nowadays opening an account without giving a valid residential address is impossible partially because of the new laws to prevent scandals like these and because of tax concerns even numbered accounts will now have an address on record and because they are electronic handing the mandate of an account over to another client advisor is easy. But in the mid 1900s it wasn't that straight forward. Numbered accounts would rarely have an address associated with them and even if they had one the bank would **never** send any mail to that address or even mention the address on any documents. The reason for this is simple: The very reason you would get a numbered account for was so nobody would know it existed. For example if you were a German jew and in fear that your possessions would get confiscated by the Nazis and you got a numbered account you would know that there was no way for them to get to it. Even if they would ask the bank the bank simply wouldn't even possess the information that you had an account. This is the very reason numbered accounts and the bank secrecy law existed to protect your account from anyone who wanted to get to your assets. The irony here is that Swiss banks then in the 1990s were then crucified for sticking to this principle of never revealing the identities of their clients.  

So the only way the bank would know that you are dead / or likely dead was if either one of your descendants showed up with a death certificate or if they could assume you were dead because you'd be 100 something years old by the time. There simply wasn't another way back then and the bank actually had no obligation to do anything other than holding on to your money. Nowadays they basically have to prove that they had contact with you at least every 24 months and after that they have to ""do their best"" to either find you or your descendants but these rules were not created until the 2000s before there simply was no precedent to what would need to be done or what was expected.  

So imagine now you are the bank. The explicit purpose of a numbered account is to be as anonymous as possible. All you have is an account number and maybe a name and a 50+ year old address in a country that doesn't exist anymore / is currently split in 2 (cold war). You can now either publicly look for the original owner of the account, which would be against the secrecy law and against the purpose of a numbered account. Or you can say nothing and wait for someone to claim the account.  

Now the rules are that after the 24 months of no contact they go looking for the owner, if they are unable to find the owner (reasonable effort based on account value and information they have) they would hand over the assets to a public advocate who would publish the owners name in a public directory of abandoned assets for 12 months and after that all unclaimed assets go to the Swiss state.  

____

Now the last point and this is what truly pisses me off about this situation, the role of the USA in this whole scandal and why everyone knows about it and talks about it to this day, why there is so much misinformation etc.  

The USA are a bunch of hypocrites and we all know it but actually this entire case, sorry if I sound like a conspiracy nut here but it's actually true if you think about it for more than a second, was just a ploy for them to undermine the Swiss banking secrecy law because they were so god damn salty that they couldn't collect every conceivable tax dollar possible from their citizens. Why am I saying this? The law suit was brought against UBS and other banks in the USA not in Switzerland. Even though none of the actual events occurred in the US. The US granted asylum to the ""whistleblower"" and gave him a nice payday of USD 250k (ironically he returned to Switzerland a decade later without a penny because he and this are his own words ""there exists no social system in the US""). The US media also did a nice job of sensationalising this story and as you can see from the state of the wiki article rarely bothered to stick to the facts. The claimants of the lawsuit don't even have a direct connection to the assets that were at UBS they were simply opportunists that saw a chance for a lawsuit thanks to holocaust outrage. During the entire lawsuit the US heavily pressured Switzerland to undermine it's bank secrecy laws. And from the beginning the government of the US involved itself heavily in the lawsuit. Also the fucking commission they created to find dormant accounts cost CHF 300 million to run just to find only 95 million (24 million actually linked to victims of Nazi Germany)

____

Anyway nobody will give a shit about my comment and keep spreading these falsehoods about Swiss banks, Nazi gold and how they stole money from Jews but just read the summary of the report in the actual article about the law suit and tell me it wasn't just a fucking clown show and in the end the settlement was just to show ""sympathy"" to the victims of the holocaust where some rich US Jews and the US government (and the state of Israel) profited by exploiting the story of some unfortunate souls who perished in the holocaust.

I'm assuming Kyiv gets something like 3-4 daily hours  of sun per day, so they are less efficient than putting them in the southern US desert where I live, but still perfectly economically viable *even outside of an emergency situation*.  For an emergency situation it's simple - you need one person to drive a truckload from Europe to Kyiv, another dozen or so people to do routine mechanical work to install them, a construction leader to coordinate the placement, and an electrician to handle the connections.   It's a very easy DIY task. At around USD$1.50 per ""watt"" for the equipment and 2.5 hours of production per day (both fairly conservative guesses), that's something like USD$1.60 per kWh ammortized over the first year.

China must have one of the worst strategic positions in history - probably the most food and energy insecure nation worldwide, certainly relative to it's huge population. A house of cards at the best of times.

China would have to expand - immediately - to acquire the food and energy resources necessary just to prevent the largest famine in history. Hundreds of millions would die within months otherwise. 
And they have no allies, but plenty of wary neighbours.

Their economy is heavily export dependent/integrated with the global economy, so any aggressive/expansionist action leaves them incalculably more exposed to sanction than what we've seen with Russia.

Their only real option would be to grab large chunks of Russia immediately, but Russia, or whatever remains if the Federation collapses, would almost certainly resort to nukes.
Same for India, which presumably could start a chain reaction with Pakistan.
Japan will be nuclear armed within a weekend if threatened.

China is quite dichotomous, very densely populated cities and empty underdeveloped rural areas, leaving them very vulnerable.

China might be able to win a few battles, especially with inferior opponents, but it's very difficult to see how China could sustain anything other than an extremely short war without extremely dramatic consequences."

I kinda think ""russophobia"" might be a Russian-manufactured term so they have something to blame and can play victims instead of owning their mistakes and facing the consequences of them. Something like your standard narcissist denial persecution fare of ""It's not me who's wrong. It's the world."""

In fact, I'd say it makes your opinion much less valuable in a discussion like this, since it's colored by generational Russophobia. Hey, it's not your fault, countries bordering Russia usually have a good reason to dislike Russia, but it doesn't mean that you should let it color your views in a situation where calm and rational solutions are needed.

>All Russia will be able to do is continue its terror.

You say that with such nonchalance, as if it wasn't actual living people whose lives are being destroyed in this war by the terror. How many Ukrainians are you willing to sacrifice before Ukraine and Russia should sit down by the negotiating table? Because I can guarantee you, it's not going to be Russian civilians who will die due to Ukrainian terror bombings. 

De facto control doesn't mean anything when those territories you control are bombed every day. Once Ukraine succesfully recaptures their territories, they'll need to sit down and hopefully come away with a peace deal that guarantees the safety of Ukrainians. You can't just call it quits unilaterally."

Tanks as far as the eye can see? What about HIMARS systems? Surely they would be part of a NATO doctrine, yet why did Germany only order 1200 rockets? If Germany and others had been spending 2% GDP on military, what would these countries have been buying this whole time in line with NATO doctrine? Just planes and tanks? No artillery? What even is NATO doctrine?

There are a handful of NATO doctrinal documents such as Allied Joint Doctrine for Land Operations, Allied Land Tactics, and Command and Control of Allied Land Forces, but they vary too much to be codified and standardized into a single doctrine.

When you say ""There simply wasnt a forseen scenario of heavy-duty artillery wars grinding for months"".. but isn't that how Russia fights wars? This would have been too dangerous for russians to do because we'd just immediately bomb their artillery from the sky?

I have zero faith that a short range ballistic missile will decelerate from near hypersonic speeds to get a clear picture for its own emissions or receive updated terminal guidance guidance, then have the flight surfaces to actually action something 13 NM away from its ballistic path, and then be able to hit something the size of a ship sprinting and maneuvering at those speeds. 

It's the same issue of using lower altitude hypersonics to kill anything that isn't stationary - you have limited ways to communicate with it once it processes a plasma sheath and likewise it can't emit, and a separate issue for a ballistic weapon is it has limited flight surfaces to actually go that far in a terminal decelerated phase where it can communicate again (most MIRV warhead for example are going to start their small creep to their target while literally in space - even though yes they are moving a lot faster and a lot higher than what is for all intents and purposes short range ballistic missiles).

Separately, even if you can get mid-course comms to it when it's in the upper atmosphere and slower with less interference from less atmosphere being heated, you need immensely accurate ISR data fused in real time and relayed which would be a huge challenge for the US with our wall of dedicated systems let alone anyone else.

Finally, hitting anything as relatively small as even a carrier moving with a ballistic weapon is really, really hard. Good real world CEPs are about the width of a flight deck, and that assumes the flight deck is perfectly still.

So yes, something to be aware of, but really it's more Chinese A2/AD just like their S-400 knock off batteries all over the Spratleys. Sure they're designed to actually mission kill something, but really their huge range, while threatening to challenge, is more just to keep pushing you away, just like how an S-400 engaging at the edge of range isn't going to kill anything aware that it's being launched at, but you'll keep running away from it, aren't going to get close enough to launch an ARM at it (yet - we're working on that), and are less likely to, without having your initial combat posture, push further in towards it where its p(k) gets higher but also it can now distract you and kill your energy which makes you more vulnerable to other systems.

A CVBG under routine ASBM harassment isn't launching flight ops, probably stops emitting if it has other assets near by that can (since it's not going to shoot down an ASBM in all realism), and isn't getting closer to the Chinese mainland where super-sonic anti-ship missiles from multiple vectors actually could overwhelm and kill a whole CVBG distracted by China's ASBM vaporware vollies.

And in that regard, the system works. China pumps up a lot of vaporware in its press just like the Russians. But I will give them credit as, despite the bullshit that hits their papers, they do seem to have very credible integrated plan for all of these systems that are all about making the opportunity cost for US involvement in an invasion of Taiwan or further annexation in the South China Sea too high to pursue, or would stall and blunt a response enough to allow them to finish their operation to establish a new status quo to negotiate from in the event of a longer war. It's smarter and a quietly a lot more self aware than the bullshit that the Ruskis spee on a day to day basis."

The only real reputable source I could find from the first page was from Radio Free Liberty which according to Wiki is US based, and that ""Radio Free Europe is often seen as an outlet for American propaganda and US interests more generally"". Their only source is an Ukrainian webpage. They also end the article with ""Due to the ongoing conflict in Kherson, RFE/RL could not immediately confirm Khlans claims."" so.

The story seems plausible and I don't doubt some people in the intelligence community saw the outcome of the war earlier on, leading to stuff like selling assets and preparing to leave Russia, but it's hardly ""all over the internet"".

It also is nowhere close to ""too many sources on Google to search""; most hits lead directly to Twitter, which is just repeating the same story without any point of origin. u/VaccinatedVariant

I did find a Business Insider article about one Russian official purchasing an apartment in Kyiv before the war started, but that's just a story about one guy. In addition, this guy didn't buy an apartment aboard because he believed the war would fail, but that they would win so fast and he wanted to own property in Ukraine after it all was done so he could move in there. Which is the opposite of Russian officials already knowing Russia would lose; that's a Russian official thinking Russia would win.

u/lukeworldwalker where can I find ""the OSINT guys"" write-up? It would definitely be good to have access to such a source directly.

It's dangerous, even for this subreddit, when truth is no longer confirmed and only repeated, especially when said in such a careless manner as ""it's known by everyone"" when in fact it might not have any ties to reality.

So I echo the other guy, source?"

There will be no invading of Russia, no sort of surrender where the 'allies' can dictate the terms.

You can never totally defeat a nuclear powered country.  

Russia's war aims have likely changed since February as well.  I think them securing any of the annexed territories will be viewed as a victory on their part, even if it's short of what they originally wanted, which was either total annexation Ukraine, or at least a regime change to install a Russian puppet government to have effective control of the country. 

>What makes you think that their poorly trained mobiks with some Iranian body armour and some additional missiles will fare better?

I very much hope that Stoltenbergs plan to created a layered defense system for Ukraine comes to fruition so this Russian strategy falls short. 

Still, knowing that Russian missile stockpile numbers are much lower than Russia would have anticipated at this point in the conflict, its hard not to wonder what theyll do when those numbers reach a very critical level. They cannot produce missiles en masse, lack necessary technology for manufacturing, and already have a capped production capacity for things like the Kalibr missile. Its been reported that the Iskander supply is very low, which is both good and bad simultaneously. 

As much as I want Russias quiver to run dry, I worry that once theyve expended all their non-nuclear options itll leave only one choice for them.  Still, Russia over expends their missile resources and cannot match production to keep pace.

My whole point is that first, Ukraine needs to put Russia in a position where negotiations would be preferable to continuing the fight, i.e. recapture all territory, and make it unfeasible for Russia to engage in offensives. Then you can convene a peace treaty.

And yes, I do believe from that position, you can make certain concessions that Russia would accept, but would secure Ukraine's territorial integrity for the long term. If Ukraine pushed out Russia from its territory, and accepted a two-way guarantee between East and West (basically an *actually enforceable* Budapest Memorandum), like what Austria got in 1955, that would secure that Ukraine could stay independent and neutral."

There are  many factors that combined to make him as immovable as he is, he governed in a time when insane amounts of EU funding came in every year and got spent, in a wholly unsupervised manner, by his appointees. Its hard to win an election against an incumbent when times are good, and with that much money flowing in, times will be good. Its even harder to win when the incumbent buys out and manually controls most media, when they rewrite the election laws, the constitution, and have handpicked appointees in every office that should provide oversight. 

One example: the richest man in Hungary at the moment is someone who, before 2010, was a simple gas repairperson who happened to have been Orbans childhood friend. He has done nothing of note, invented nothing, he is a wholly unremarkable dumbfuck who is now worth over a billion EUR.

The German car industry and the EU leadership have subsidized all this. It boggled my mind that it took until 2021 (!!) for FIDESZ to be thrown out of the EPP. Eleven fucking years. The constitution rewrite, election system rewrite, all that, was year 2-3 in this process. Orban Viktors son-in-law had a company using EU funds to install LED lighting all over Hungary well before year 8. (This last one ended up being so indefensible that Hungary just opted out of the funding post fact, the clearest admission of guilt you could have) 

I understand peoples ire with my country, all I can say is : some of us dont want this, and propaganda is a hell of a drug. 12 years of brainwashing is a crazy amount. Think about it, the nazis came to power in 1933. By 1939, they started WWII. 6 years. By 1941, the Holocaust had begun. Thats 8 years. This has been 12."

About Nato: I think some competition between designs is useful and necessary for development. What you described was the concept of cold war Nato, where everyone played their role to a certain degree (Germany preparing for highly mobile outnumbered tank defense warfare against a red wave - and conventional submarines, utilizing its huge experience from WW2). But somehow most European armies left that path but did not develop any consequence in their new layouts. What is the German army supposed to be? One highly specialiced wheel in the Nato machine? An army which has every necessary capability of fighting asymetric wars or smaller conflicts? Or go the overly expensive US way and create a defence force which can deter any threat on their own, which, in my eyes, would include nuclear deterrence in some form? I would be fine with any path, but for fucks sake, our strategists and gouvernments should finally pick one."

Another point of mine, and maybe even more important one, was that even the Orbn supporters dont support him on the basis of Russia. That was not his platform in March. At the end of February and throughout Spring, the Hungarian government was one of the first to officially open its borders to Ukrainians. 

Fidesz voters usually support Orbn because they are anti-LGBT or anti-immigration or even anti-Brussels (Brussels being the one that forces gay rights and immigrants on Hungary). These have been the enemies of Fidesz over the years. None of these things are to be confused with being anti-Ukrainian or pro-Russian.

The Pzh2000 was designed for a war not too dissimilar from this, but with the assumption of full supply and logistics chains, replacement and field attrition.

This has, obviously, been reduced over 30 years of peace, and I am honestly surprised there were any in circulation at all.

There is coal, wood, and oil everywhere and millions of tons can be shipped in. Heat for cooking, water sterilization, and warmth is the number 1 priority and fire is the answer to that. Batteries and generators will be shipped in as well in greater and greater supply, and installations will get more and more elaborate. I suspect that we will begin to see large fences and screens/netting being erected around high-value targets. This is the same as bombing campaigns of old and new challenges mixed in.

So 2 Russian missiles plus a Ukrainian interceptor?!?

Some early posts during the attack mentioned were saying 2 Russian missiles. If true, the simplest explanation for all this seems to be the interceptor(s) exploded in the air and caused both Russian missiles to go down and explode when hitting the ground.

Thus, NATO could claim the Ukrainian interceptor caused the explosions (to occur) in Poland (instead of Ukraine), and avoid escalation to a direct conflict.

The problem is the tubes, if the tubes bend, start to crack from pressure, wear down due to too much firing, or the breach block goes awry like not sealing thats when problems arise. 

In this case the barrels are probably worn out, and need to be removed and rebored or resleeved depending on how severe it is, and how each particular gun is handled. 

All of which was at one point done in Ukraine with their own tubes, sadly they dont have the tooling or machines for western maintenance most likely as its different standards and specifications. Outside that hydraulic system repairs, track repairs, recoil systems can be taught quickly and easily.

They went in and offered peace to these invaders, and some of them died or at least came close to it, putting their lives on the line to take these men. Those that risked it all to bring peace are the loss here."

But in 1991 the Soviet Union fell and the Cold War was over so began the long draw down of Western militaries because they weren't expecting a shooting war at any minute. So the suppliers of artillery parts and ammunition also draws down production to peacetime levels.

Then the artillery piece gets to see actual combat after 9/11, using up stocks but not at such a rate that the supplier can't keep up.

Fast forward to now, the Ukrainian military is firing 7000 rounds of artillery every day, dwarfing the typical supply needs of any Western military and as such, requires a time period of retooling, retraining and expanding the industrial base to supply the parts and ammunition for said artillery.

My opinion is that both US and EU are skizophrenic about NATO.

One side of the US wants EU to have an army/defense that can deal with all the threats EU may have to face (or much closer to be on par with US), which would means EU would not need the help and protection of US anymore. But the other side of the US also want to keep the hegemony and dominance over NATO command and strategy and be the ""power player"" in europe.

Part of the EU wants to save on army/defense costs (especially since the Berlin's wall fell and the end of USSR), because objectively the threats EU has to face aren't has big as how a powder keg europe was in the late 19th and 20th centuries, conveniently using the shield prodvided by the US (at US cost), satisfying US desire to be the dominant power over the old continent. But the other part wants an EU army independant from NATO to conduct deployments and operations without the need to consult anyone. 

The two sides of each actor is mutually exclusive. But each actor want both. Skizophrenia. 

As an historical point, this Europe and US skizophrenia, the ""europeanisation"" vs the ""atlantisation"" of the defense, is one of the many reasons (some being understandable from a sovereignty point of vue, others being much more dubious) why France decided to get out of the integrated command of NATO in 1966 ant stopped providing troops to the alliance (though was still under the mutual defense pact). Reintegration is quite recent : 2009. And France idea hasn't changed : France want an EU army that is independant of the US and NATO (and France want to be in the military lead of europe... so not an innocent idea at all).

At the end, i'm thinking is intensive re-militarisation of Europe, to get rid of US dominance and presence on the continent, is really a good idea ? When I look at how much far-right have grown up all over the european continent during the last 40 years, I'm not sure I want to see in 2040 Poland, Italy, France, Germany, etc, all armed to the teeth, ready to fight anything, and led or widely influenced by far-right whou would surely agitate the nationalism, the patriotism, the racism, and the revengeful warlike spirit..."

A) Guy with weapon is shot, all those on the ground remain down and don't move/panic or whip out their own weapons. No further fire.  
B) Guy with weapon shot, some/all of those on ground produce weapons or attempt to charge/flee/stand. Immediate fight results in deaths, soldiers on ground panic as those next to them are killed either from stray fire or due to aggression.

I can't really imagine a situation where the Ukrainians, in cold blood, simply shoot every man on the ground - unless a few of them attempt to attack or aggress/panic in some way.

 [Soviet invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956#Soviet_invasion) 
 
 >On 1 November, Imre Nagy received reports that Soviet forces had entered Hungary from the east and were moving towards Budapest. Nagy sought and received assurances, which proved to be false, from Soviet Ambassador Yuri Andropov that the Soviet Union would not invade. The Cabinet, with Jnos Kdr in agreement, declared Hungary's neutrality, withdrew from the Warsaw Pact and requested assistance from the diplomatic corps in Budapest and Dag Hammarskjld, UN Secretary-General, to defend Hungary's neutrality. Andropov was asked to inform his government that Hungary would begin negotiations on the removal of Soviet forces immediately.

Europe, living under the US nuclear umbrella, is living in a state of artificially-provided security in a way that has never existed before. There has never been a superpower with such strength that can protect a group of 30 countries at 1/12th the world's population that that group of countries doesn't even have to worry so much about security and can spend money on different things. Throughout the history of nation-states with borders, the costs for providing security to your nation were astronomical. Most of the male population would have seen combat in one form or another. 

Due to NATO and the US nuclear umbrella and security guarantees, Europe was able to stop the trend towards constant suspicion towards neighbors and start working with each other for once. One form was the ECSC which eventually turned into the European Union. And somehow it has escaped hundreds of millions of Europeans that this entire peace project of the EU is all based on NATO and is to an extent ""artificial"" or ""not real."" Even though they realized this, they started to make arguments for why ""realism"" or ""neo-realism"" or ""Realpolitik"" were inaccurate and developed theories like Constructivism which says that ""security is a social construct."" One convenient advantages to such lenses through which to see the world is Europe suddenly has billions and billions of dollars that they can now spend on things like healthcare instead of on military spending. 

And it works until it doesn't. 

[This](https://www.ted.com/talks/peter_van_uhm_why_i_chose_a_gun?language=en) Ted Talk (Peter van Uhm) is a great example of sectors of European society that have been working to shake this false belief in the notion of ""Constructivism"" and to remind folks of the grave importance of providing for your own security. 

Anyway, all else being equal, can Europe *really* be sure they will be able to trust that the USA will come to save the day forever? Trump is an example of how the winds can shift. When will Trump 2.0 be elected? I wouldn't say never. 

It's absolutely time for Europe to start getting serious about providing for its own security and to start spending 3-4% GDP on defense across the board."

If there is e.g. a 220kV transmission line, and hypothetically the last available transformer at the substation was destroyed in an attack, but there's 50 110kV transformers available on a short notice, then there is no reason why the 220kV line couldn't be used as 110kV transmission line with the available parts, if properly configured.

Of course this would mean reduced transmission capacity, but even a quarter of normal capacity would be sufficient for normal residential use, if people are smart in their energy usage. 

Lights, radio, computer are ok, but e.g. blowdryer, electric kettle, and a daily bath are not necessary for survival in war time conditions.

I was writing that because there had been an earlier post about some indispensable transformer that got destroyed and people were going like ""Whelp, I guess we'll die now"".

Germany doesn't have spare parts to supply, it happens, as I stated earlier Germany didn't plan to ever see a full scale war in Europe ever again, and that's an admirable thing they hoped peace would be long lasting, they probably had enough parts stocked for 2-3 months of short term warfare and that's it, since that's what most wars were in years, short, conflicts and peace keeping actions, not so much full on national level warfare.

> The Ukrainian leader repeated his calls for Ukraine&#039;s partners to offer &quot;Full protection of the Ukrainian sky&quot;, saying that to do so would encourage Russia to end the war.

These people will struggle. It will be hard. But this is recoverable and maintainable. I would be shocked if we don't start seeing mass-produced wood stove kits show up all over the country. And by the millions. Add a Peltier cooler, a fan, and a battery to it and you can have heat, cooking, and power enough to get by. There is coal, wood, and oil everywhere and millions of tons can be shipped in. Heat for cooking, water sterilization, and warmth is the number 1 priority and fire is the answer to that. Batteries and generators will be shipped in as well in greater and greater supply, and installations will get more and more elaborate. I suspect that we will begin to see large fences and screens/netting being erected around high-value targets. This is the same as bombing campaigns of old and new challenges mixed in. The situation always gets worse before the solutions start showing up, but necessity is the mother of invention and they will get what they need. Russia can go to hell, but Ukraine will be recovering by Christmas unless I miss my mark.

Allowing the Russians to maintain the fantasy that it's just fine to keep hitting civilian infrastructure deep in Western Ukraine or along the Polish border, because reasons and ""special Russia"" and ""we have nukes"" is a very bad idea and not at all how NATO or the United States responded to Soviet provocation throughout the cold war. Not at all. 

It is obviously true that the only reason the Russians are launching wave after wave of missiles deep into Ukraine is the certainty of no reprisals. If the Ukrainians had the capacity to respond with direct strikes on the Black Sea fleet, or staging areas for the Russian missile strikes, this wouldn't be happening. If the US declared that this capability would be provided it would stop. 

""For the purposes of this exercise, proxy forces don't count""

Ukraine is not the US and also not a NATO member, we can provide whatever weapons we want to them without directly attacking Russia. Are we suddenly in a hot war with Iran because they have equipped Russia with missiles and drones? No, that would be silly. This works both ways, just as it did in the cold war.

Of course the Russians would threaten a Nuclear response, but they would not mean it. They don't actually want to die. 

They also don't want to have their failures in Ukraine spill over into their own Federation and result in the balkanization of the former Russian Federation. 

At the moment their calculation is that attacking Ukraine's power grid is not very risky. It's time to convince them otherwise. It could be done with policy declarations and speeches and it could be done intelligently. 

The stupid, risky move was invading Ukraine in the first place and believing their own propaganda. Now that they have started a ware on their border, it's insane to demand that Ukraine not retaliate within Russia. No nation suporting Ukraine would allow itself to be attacked and limit its response in this way. Ukrainian special ops have already taken place around Belgorod and in various places that Russia considers within Russia (e.g. Crimea and now all the other occupied parts of Ukraine.)

The shameful, wrong and stupid move would be to insist that Ukraine just has to take it and we'll provide them with enough to slow and gradually erode Russian power and slowly, slowly push back while millions are left in the dark an cold and civilians in their apartments far, far from the front keep getting blown to hell by Russian missiles. 

It's not an escalation to all out war with Russia to take the position that the sustained attack on the power grid is not acceptable and will now result in painful and destructive consequences if it doesn't stop.

In case anyone has forgotten how hard the edge of the cold war got...

The tritium powers the fusion portion of a hydrogen bomb.  The original Atomic bombs were, for lack of a better word, inefficient.  The thermal nuclear and later hydrogen bombs combined really good understandings of physics with material science to increase that efficiency thus substantially increasing yield.  That all said, modern thermal and hydrogen bombs generally still start the chain reaction with a good old fashioned ""inefficient"" fission event that is unlikely to have decayed to a non-working state.  Remember the hydrogen isotopes like deuterium and tritium are added with plutonium and u235 and u238 in layers around that u235 initial fission event with the goal to raise the efficiency from ~2% of Hiroshima to better than %20 (guessing here, but given the efficiency of early fission weapons has be released as high as 17% and the only other docs i can find about newer stuff basically says ""significantly more efficient than stand alone fission"". I think >20% a safe conservative guess).  They accomplish this extra efficiency by basically stacking fision and fusion reactions to make more neutrons to re-fission the original fusion core releasing more energy triggering more fusion to make more fission so on and so forth until designers ran out of room in the bomb case. 

So what's the TLDR?  The hydrogen isotopes decaying will lower the efficiency of the reaction and may even prevent the expected cascade reactions, but we'll still very much have the initial fusion reaction.  Thus they will most likely go boom, but will probably ~only~ be an inefficient fission event.  Hiroshima's pure fission bomb was 15KT in size.  The hydrogen fusion bombs tzar Bomba or bikini atoll were 50MT or 15MT respectively.  

For some added relief, I'm guessing the half dead tritium, and unused fissile plutonium/uranium boosters will probably just be finely spread and float about on the wind as nuclear fallout."

EDIT2 - also, you are not likely to miss with GMLRS vs ATACMS, I'm not sure how you would say the two are different regarding precision... they're both GPS guided"

These are largely practical matters. Normally you have to take ""reasonable care"" and avoid ""negligence"". Also normally war is a total mess and people are allowed to keep themselves safe.

If there were hundreds of heavily armed and protected Ukrainian soldiers and small groups of Russians you would expect them to separate the Russians rapidly and make them safe. At that point more than a few being killed would be a serious failure on the Ukrainian side. 

If a huge group of Russians surrendered to one Ukrainian (has happened in WWII near the end where Germans were desperately looking for Western forces to surrender to - e.g. an entire German unit surrendered to a cook who was out walking with just his pistol) then the surrendering group is almost entirely responsible for safety until they get back to the base. They need to ensure that none of their group has a weapon themselves.

In this case we are in an unfortunate and very dangersous situation with a relatively small Ukrainian unit trying to do safe surrender for a larger Russian unit. If there had been more Ukrainians than there were then the Russians should have been moved in smaller groups, checked and disarmed and then the others sorted separately. In that case, killing the ones that had already been checked and 

>  Openly criticizing war crimes as specified by the Geneva convention (not rules that you just make up in your head) is not supporting Russia. 

No, but deliberately spreading falsehoods about war crimes in a war where there are already plenty of such is very very dodgy indeed. You clearly haven't bothered to put much effort into understanding this and yet you are here blaming people who were doing their best in difficult circumstances. 

Given the tendency for the Russian side to act exactly as you are and, in fact given that the videos of this incident have been released deceptively edited by the Russian side and you are pushing the same narrative as those that pushed deceptive edits, you are clearly either negligent or in conspiracy with people who are supporting war crimes. 

> If you dont believe you can support Ukraine while criticizing the isolated incidents of war crimes that some of their soldiers have committed, then there is something seriously wrong with you.

I'm on clear record here demanding Ukraine investigates accusations of war crimes that have been made. 

Actual words have real effects here. By making false accusations here, you may cause Russian soldiers who would otherwise have surrendered and lived to fight in hopeless situations or even kill themselves. You may also put Ukrainian soldiers attempting to accept surrenders into danger and make others less willing to take risks to accept surrender. You have a responsibility to inform yourself.

It's an expedition. You need equipment and (expired) rations and transport. Those all require manpower (so more equipment, rations, and transport) and guards or the enemy will attack supply chains. An inferior soldier requires almost as much support as a good soldier (maybe worse rations and equipment, but much more supervision). A bad tanks may cost more to field than a good tank.

A mechanic fixing the broken a truck that's transporting conscripts can't fix the T72 that an elite unit is waiting for (after they accidently left their T80 behind).

A real war requires logistics. You don't intentionally send poor troops to the front.

No, that's the merit-order system in the European energy market. You always pay the cost of the most expensive producer. Usually that's nuclear (unless you are France and cheat by capping the cost below market value and subsidizing the company), but with the inflated gas price that's now gas.

That would be ridiculous. Also, there are good reasons jets haven't been sent yet. I think they should be, but I doubt they will at this point in time. What I'm saying is that it is silly to think this will cripple Ukraine because it won't. They are not so weak that this is the last straw and they will be crippled from here on out and have to give up. It won't happen and is silly to think it will. Just like it is silly to think that Russia has the capacity to keep launching 100+ missiles a week, they don't have even the capacity to make close to that many new ones and the stocks are getting low. It's also silly to think that the west is just going to let Ukraine sit there without support for the infrastructure. Germany alone has already sent almost 2,500 industrial generators. To think that there is no support coming, or that has been delivered and that all is lost and Ukraine will be permanently crippled is silly. It's not true, and not going to happen. Russia made a move and changed the game in the last month, but Ukraine is responding and already solving these issues. In a month they will have made even more progress and the strike threat will be minimal I'm sure. The next real risk, to be honest, is going to be the Russian pivot from cruise missiles to ballistic missiles when they realize that the cruise missiles are no longer a threat. That will be risky as it will be an obvious escalation, and if they prove to be supplied from Iran, it will trigger a reciprocal escalatory reaction from the west. Probably with ATACMS  but possibly even pushing all the way to Fighter Jets. But to say that Ukraine is crippled right now, or that they will be crippled shortly, is just silly."

They desperately need more tanks and artillery there but they just don't have it and the West for whatever reason doesn't want to give them more.

It's probably why they said the missiles in Poland were Ukrainian. Lots of talk there were two missiles and either both were Russian or one was Russian that was followed by a Ukrainian S300 trying to take it down.

So unless Russia actually puts boots on the ground in NATO countries, I would imagine the odd missile or two every now and again fired into Poland or the Baltics will be excused. NATO really needs to draw a red line but I just don't think they have it in them.

Cruise missiles are by nature extremely difficult to acquire and shoot down. They fly incredibly low (often below 1000ft AGL) and while they are slower than a Mach capable fighter, they make course changes in flight and are quite small. 

Those two things together mean that they are difficult to detect from far away. Low cruising altitude means they quickly fall below the radar/visual horizon. Their small size further decreases the ranges at which a significant radar return is generated. 

It turns out that one of the more reliable ways to shoot down cruise missiles is with planes looking at or down on them with air-air missiles. This is obviously challenging though, because  is a large country, and most target search radars on Ukrainian planes areaged, especially their MiG 29 fleet. You also have to chase a missile with a planewhich is inconvenient and time consuming.

Nobody of them is gonna start a war involvement over one citizen, but they might possibly, if it's a government official. See the Poland missile strike, where the polish and US statement of the ""investigation"" is extremely dubious.

Yes, precedent is definitely arbitrary in practical use. The theory is pretty straight forward, but the actual decision in the real world is a whole different topic.

>and all the proxying is doing is getting more people killed by making the conflict drag on longer, because there's no middle ground end-game. Russia couldn't dream of holding ground against NATO proper, so either Russia eventually withdraws, or it resorts to the only real weapons it has and we end up in nuclear war.

And exactly that is the problem and literally the sole and only reason, why NATO hasn't curb-stomped Russia yet. They know, what even a single nuclear missile can cause in terms of damage. Europe still feels the effects of Tschernobyl to this day and that was almost 40 years ago.

>As for pro-russia people, I certainly don't care about placating them as they aren't worth consideration in any international diplomacy, and I honestly think you're overestimating their numbers

Maybe, but their numbers have actually been rising since the start of the war and THAT is concerning. These people are so extremely delusional, that they can truly be called nothing but ""bot"" or ""troll"". They use extremely vile and immoral methods of communication and neither social media companies nor society actually try to silence them. Most people have lost the ability to oppose extremely damaging speech and instead hide behind ""tolerance"". 

Under normal circumstances, every single of the pro-Russia social media accounts should be deleted and those protesters should be charged with treason, just like neo-Nazi protests should be handled, but that never happens. Freedom of speech/freedom to protest is a double-edged sword, just like freedom of the press in their respective current forms. We need those freedoms, but at the same time they take away our means to fight against behavior that is very dangerous to society or even humanity.

And as for international diplomacy. Hungary just now shows how utterly feeble, defenseless, unstable, incompetent and indecisive Western politics are. Hungary keeps pulling EU by the nose, despite being so utterly insignificant in itself. If everything went correctly, Hungary (and most likely even turkey) would've been thrown out of NATO a LOOONG time ago.

>If they're just willfully ignorant or victims of propaganda, that's a social issue to be dealt with in other ways.

They are all adults, I adamantly refuse to accept the defense of ""victim of propaganda"" in today's world. The only ones that might still get through with it are North Koreans and some other very underdeveloped nations, where people simply don't have access to other sources.

>But then I'm also one of those wackos that thinks the FCC should be given the power to regulate cable and streaming, and shut certain programs down unless they comply with the Fairness Doctrine.

Whilst there are others who are suggesting similar things, I never have and that's a strawman. By the time thousands are surrendering that has to be spread out enough in both space and time that there should be some of them either fully captured or still fully unsurrendered and so that one action could really only affect those who were surrendering in the same area at the same time. 

The responsibility of the capturing force for the safety of prisoners begins from when those prisoners are in custody. These prisoners are not. 

The definition of ""hors de combat"" also doesn't yet fully apply to them also because they are part of an apparently surrendering _formation_ where actually, because that formation still has an armed member. However, it's an interesting question of whether they, themselves

So let's do a little analysis of the actors.

* Ukrainian fighters here - set up a reasonable and normal surrender. Did not harm any prisoners until attacked. - Clearly innocent victims. 
* Russians apparently surrendering - complex to tell - we can't be sure whether they knew about the perfidy - others have suggested that they looked back, but that does not show intent directly and is not sufficient evidence to blame them
* Russian who faked surrender and then attacked - a clear war criminal and all acts here fall on him and are a consequence of his perfidy
* Russian leadership - there is clear evidence of them encouraging acts of perfidy. Likely guilty of war crimes
* Me - I have no control of Ukrainians and I encourage following the rules of war and accepting surrenders - innocent
* You - I wonder. Are you perhaps part of or connected to Russia - clearly trying to displace blame for perfidy - if you believe that you have influence over Russian fighters then likely you are a criminal trying to encourage perfidy by displace blame; more likely just misinformed on the internet."

You listed a few far right Russian groups that have no power or influence whatsoever (unlike in Ukraine where the Banderite Nazi movement is literally the dominant culture that controls the parliament) then wrote ""Izhevsk"" which is literally just a place in Russia. 

I assume you are referring to the school shooting which happened there which was perpetrated by a Nazi aligned actor but that still proves nothing as the shooter was also a former student of the school and a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic so I'm not really sure what the point is supposed to be. 

You even write ""Kolovrat"" in your comment which is a Nazi symbol seen in both countries but more often in Ukraine than in Russia so I really don't understand the point you're trying to make.

A division is a unit. At what point is the line drawn?

You admit that there isnt sufficient evidence to blame the surrendered Russians for their officer opening fire. So why is it acceptable to shoot them? They were not a threat at the time. 

As for speculating that Im connected to Russia thats just delusional.

From the point of view of the perfidious Russian, I believe not.

I believe he is responsible for the intentional killing of a large group of non-combatants.

There's a really complicated discussion about negligence. Should the Russians that were surrendering have made sure that he put his weapon away safely so that he couldn't attack the Ukrainians. If they were truly careless then they might also share blame for the Ukrainian who was harmed. I don't think that's likely if we are fair to them. Surrender is very messy and they likely did their best to make it safe, coming out unarmed and one at a time. It's very difficult to control your whole unit.

I concur with that analysis though that it's a long term threat, as is the tactical application of hypotonic glide vehicles that stay in the stratosphere. And as a result, it's something that we need to think about regarding hard counters (nothing comes close to existing now - SM-6 is not set up to really handle this), but that's still a long way.

To be frank, China is light years ahead of Russia in regards to actually having their shit work (that being said, their fuck in Ukraine is far beyond what anyone in our IC thought possible), and the fact they have self awareness to deficiencies in their sabre rattling plans is a sign of ability to acknowledge and action items of progress - reminiscent of the Soviet Union in the 1980s honestly.

I mean, I've already given you the proof. If you don't wish to accept it, that's on you.

>That's the definition of ad hominem.

Wrong.

Here, I'll simplify it for you:

ad hominem: ""You're wrong because [something about you as a person]""

Not ad hominem: ""You're wrong because [valid reasons] and therefore an idiot.""

I mean, try thinking about this, if you feel up to it: why would simply insulting someone be a logical fallacy, which ad hominem is? If someone is legitimately wrong and advancing an ill-founded argument, as you are in this thread, pointing out why and then calling them a moron is still advancing a valid argument, albeit impolitely. There's nothing logically incongruous about that. If someone tried to advance an argument like, say, ""It's snowing and therefore global warming is a myth"", pointing out why that's a really stupid argument and calling the person dumb in response isn't being logically fallacious, it's being honest.

By contrast, if you responded to ""It's snowing and therefore global warming is a myth,"" by saying, ""That's wrong, because you don't live somewhere where it snows, so you have no idea what you're talking about,"" that *is* an ad hominem and logically fallacious because your argument (""You don't live somewhere it snows"") has nothing to do with whether or not their argument is correct. Hence, logical fallacy.

Seriously, if you're going to use what you probably consider to be complicated words, at least learn what they mean. I shouldn't have to be correcting you on things this simple."

What I see: is that after the Russian came out shooting, Ukrainians took casualties but eliminated the shooter. Russians properly surrendering now all dead on the ground, unmoved. 

My take: could they have all been killed in crossfire? Sure, it is a possibility, but they were stretched out and behind one another, that some would have been meat shields for their comrades, so unlikely. Mortar or artillery? Unlikely, they would have sought cover. 

After shooter was eliminated, they remained prone because they were still being covered by Ukrainian rifles. My guess is that the unit vengefully, extrajudicially executed the remaining captives to atone for their deceit and inflicting casualties during a truce. I find this more believable, and unfortunate, that there was a lapse in judgement. Shit happens in war, and its not pretty. Cant look at things black and white, and good versus evil. The good guys make mistakes.

Similar to countless times in WWII when allied forces would instead execute prisoners due to similar circumstances, or when they round up Concentration Camp guards and would just shoot them instead of letting them hang or serve prison sentences. Outcome is the same, yet one is right and the other is wrong.

This is what I see from the video of the before and after, and nothing given in between. I very well could be wrong, but my speculation is also a probable scenario."

To counter cheap radio signals that might try to control those drones they could use more automated ones that use gps and inertial guiding systems so they keep following their path until something expensive is wasted on them. This way russia could also be demilitarized of its countermeasures until planes have it easier. If russia starts getting more sparing with aa rockets after finding out many drones are decoys (some decoys could deliberately have some dummy weight to make them seem to be carrying heavy bomb) then Ukranian side could adding more serious payloads to make russia regret not wasting more rockets on drones. If russians try to detect real bomb using drones by which one starts swooping down instead of being staying level then some decoy could use gps or inertial guiding system to start going down where russian sam site workers believe is something worth defending with missiles.   

Biggest plus is that such rocket wasting drones could be made with pieces random civilians could buy and make unlike artillery ammo or missiles."

I have no idea why you would equate ""magic"" with non-Christian belief systems, but even if that were the case, people voluntarily converting between religions isn't a crime or even morally questionable. And, again, if they voluntarily chose to destroy their own possessions, that's their own right and choice.

>Universities got started after the Crusades. When the Christians visited the Middle East and learned about madrassas, and brought that idea back along with the looted books the Muslims had preserved. 

Why would Christians need to see madrasas to suddenly get the idea for universities when they were already running cathedral-schools that did much the same thing as the madrasas were? Moreover, it's worth noting that, by the time of the Crusades, the Mu'tazilism school of thought in Arabic countries that had led to much of the scientific advancement of the Islamic Golden Era was in sharp decline (criminalized, in some areas) and had largely been replaced by Ash'ari, which largely spurned and was openly hostile to scientific inquiry in the Middle Ages. Furthermore, madrasas in the Middle Ages were established under waqf, which left them heavily beholden to the Islamic authorities of the era; accordingly, very few taught anything outside of what was considered the ""Islamic Sciences"" - Koranic studies, grammar, sharia, and hadith; anything outside of this sphere, which was deliberately designed and constrained to focus on the study and interpretation of Islam, was largely ignored by the madrasas of the era. Crusades-era madrasas were so different in both structure and philosophy to early universities, it is extremely unlikely that the former inspired the latter to any significant extent.

>That is the origin of universities, not the Christian church.

Even if your claim was true (and it isn't), that wouldn't mean that it wasn't the Christian church that founded the universities. That they saw someone else passing on education and thought, ""Say, that's a good idea!"" doesn't suddenly mean they're not responsible for the founding anymore.

>And then the Renaissance starts

At which point you're now in the 1500s and have basically skipped over three-quarters of the church's existence.

>And the religious universities were forbidden to non-christians, but it's the Jews and the Muslims and with the medical expertise.

Ignoring the significant advancements that early-era Christians made to medical science. Christians were some of the foremost medicinal practitioners of the early first millennium. Famously, the first hospitals were founded/invented by Christians and the First Council of Nicaea in 325 decreed that any city large enough to have a cathedral should also have a hospital, effectively providing the world's earliest form of socialized medicine. By the latter half of the first millennium, every monastery also included an infirmary for the treatment of the sick and infirm.

>It's a bigoted myth that the Christians are responsible for modern scholarship.

Hell of a strawman to try to twist what I've been saying into an argument that ""Christians are responsible for modern scholarship.""

Please restrict your arguments to what I've actually said, not what you've made up in your imagination."

Well, international humanitarian law completely disagrees with you there.

* The Ukrainian _active soldiers_ are as such legitimate targets, they are part of ""the game"".

* The surrendering Russian soldiers are not anymore, they are hors de combat, protected persons. They need to be spared and protected even if that leads to disadvantages for the other party, including loses.

>They will take prisoners if it's absolutely safe for them to do so,

* That is not how it works. And that is why we have the law, no party would like to take prisoners without the law, because it is always risky and it always has costs. 

* We don't know so far if it was justified, an accident or a war crime. But being the victim of a crime of aggression, doesn't change the rules about POWs. And from the moment there is a clear message they are surrendering and they are not showing hostile behaviour, they are protected, no matter who the aggressor is. And that is to be judged person by person. 

* So if the ones on the ground showed also hostile behaviour (which is with the footage we know very unlikely), or if they were shot in an accident or in error, it is not a war crime. If they were engaged intentionally and not in error or even executed, it is a clear and gross violation of the Geneva convention/protocol.

>the only person responsible for the lives of Russian troops is Putin.

He is primarily responsible, sure. But soldiers controlling surrendering hors-de-combat are naturally responsible for their safety and that they don't do harm to them, also."

Military defeat will make them more and more angry in the future. A perspective and reintegration into Europe without military threats and clear demands for never waging wear and giving up nuclear weapons (or like stationing them in Wladiwostok idk)
or a prohibition of arming up again or whatever could be an outcome but giving a perspective is important.

>Truthfully all the negotiations pushers are doing disservice to Ukraine, intentionally or not. 

I don't think so in general but yeah. Many people want just the war to end and make business with Russia again and have cheap energy and resources but that's not what Olaf Scholz or other negotiation pushers want (I believe, I could be wrong)
Reparations of course and the full territory needs to be given back to Ukraine. While we are at it a referendum in the occupied areas of Georgia aswell should be held under UN eyes.

From the article I linked, and I hope you agree that Sutton is a reputable source:

> From a sea of disbelief, ASBMs are a being taken increasingly seriously. Particularly Chinas ambitious program. Like any new weapons there will be challenges. And many systems may not be as capable in an operational setting as advertised. But the direction of travel is clear. And China seems determined to make it a reality.

So yes, this might not be a threat now but for sure this is giving the USN headaches regarding potential counter-measures. It's a sign of superiority that they've been so far able to develop sufficient counter-measures for all these threats, but it'd be a mistake to simply hope that the terminal guidance for ASBMs never reaches a status where it can target a carrier within a 13nmi radius of its original position."

Russians are already humiliated when they didn't achive their objectives right away. If you want to compare they are in the post WW1 or beginning of WW2 phase already.

Also, Ukraine don't seek to conquer russia.

If someone think Ukraine should make concession they just need to look at the same Germany pre-WW2 to see what appeasement will do or a russia itself after 2014. There should be no trophies for effort either and no statements with double meaning to actually discourage them from continuing.

I think we are already past the point when there can be some change in russia under current circumstances, so military defeat might actually sober them up a bit.

That's not how it works.


They are all equally guilty of perfidy.



None of them made sure all of their comrades were disarmed and guns were dropped or unloaded. They all knew he was there and hadn't surrendered yet and didn't alert any one or call out a warning or tell him to cooperate. And I am pretty sure that some of them had the angle to see him standing with the gun.


It's possible that some on the ground were not aware that they were being used as pawns to ambush the UA as part of a false surrender. That doesn't change their culpability, just as everyone in an armed robbery is equally guilty of everything that happens. It doesn't matter if the driver never held a gun. If you want to surrender, make sure all your pals are disarmed and send the hotheads out first.



Those men on the ground were also not yet POWs. They hadn't been searched and taken into custody. If the UA had actually executed confirmed unarmed and restrained men in custody, then that would be a war crime. This absolutely was not one."

A nuclear power didn't surrender, it *pulled out*. This is a crucial difference. The US wasn't at war with Afghanistan, it was fighting an insurgency. This is not applicable to the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, because the two countries are at war with one another. 

From the perspective of Russia, Ukraine is currently occupying Russian territory. From the perspective of Ukraine, Russia is occupying Ukrainian territory. This war won't be over until this is settled in a peace deal. 

I find it funny how people are saying that Ukraine should not agree to any sort of ceasefire or peace deal because that would only give Russia time to re-arm and try again at a later date, but at the same time demanding that Russia be put into a position where they cannot feasibly make another attempt. The two demands are mutually exclusive: either you come up with a peace deal that provides guarantees for Ukraine that it won't be invaded again, or Russia will invade again on the future. If Ukraine just beats the Russian forces out of Ukrainian territory, Russia will just re-arm and try again in a couple years' time, but this time with a better army that will have learned the lessons of this war. 

You also cannot talk about any sort of EU or NATO ascension until you have a settled peace deal, which, once again, will just allow Russia to attempt another invasion at a later date. 

>Russia using nukes because they lost a war would make them a pariah even in the eyes of brutal regimes like China.

No it wouldn't. Because neither Russia nor China would exist after a week. Nor NATO, or the US, or the EU, or you, or me."

Also, you forget that a third party arresting a Russian diplomat on grounds connected to the war is an active involvement in the war. I personally find it weird how the west and Iran etc. Are not already considered active war parties (for training and supplying the fighting nations), but that's just how the country leaders see it at the moment - it is what it is.

And no, diplomats as political prisoners doesn't really happen (or at least I don't hear about it).

Yes, Russia breaks every single agreement, but doing so ourselves puts us at a disadvantage and reaffirms the views of the brainwashed pro-russian population everywhere in the world. Too many people in the world are just straight up brain-dead at the moment, believing the Russian lies fully.

Flight control is accomplished by four forward-mounted canards driven by electromechanical actuators. GMLRS rockets were introduced in 2005 and can be fired from the M270A1 and M270A2, the European M270A1 variants (British Army M270B1, German Army MARS II, French Army Lance Roquette Unitaire (LRU), Italian Army MLRS Improved (MLRS-I), Finnish Army M270D1), and the lighter M142.

The ''Flaw'' is he fell into the ''Dictator trap'' of living in a echo chamber of his own thoughts, having killed anyone that put forth a realistic assessment of current events and situations.

His refusal to realistically see where this war is going is a reflection on the self image of a dictator, whom by very nature is never wrong in his own eye's.

If he looked a little further down the time line, the Western Powers are giving him a chance to stop by ramping up the weapon supply to Ukraine. It's a carrot and stick situation where you take the carrot or get hit with the stick.

The Ukrainian Armed Forces will be a well equipped mechanized army fighting a ''Modern Mechanized'' style of combat. If Putin does not withdraw the weapons flow will only increase from the West until there is a 1 million man army in Ukraine right on his border ready to take revenge for Russian war crimes.

He is caught with his army depleted and his source of conscripts empty and his weapons proved to be sub-par.

Then his only card is nuclear, which the people around him will not comply with as they know this means extinction.

""Of course, Ukraine would like negotiations. But there is one problem, and it is the same one that Zelenskyi faces every day since February 24 - there is nothing to agree on. No potential mediator has yet been able to come up with a compromise that would be even slightly acceptable."" - said the former British Prime Minister.

""Even if the Ukrainians can be convinced to give up their rights to part of their lands, although they must not, cannot and will not do this, there is no reason to believe that Putin will abide by the terms of the agreement.

Thus, in order to load the next shell, these systems have to move the drum or belt and thus they move **all** available shells. At the same time.

Moving 60x50kg is an enormous stress on motors and bearings and they fail often. Manual override is extremely slow.

While the PzH-2000 only moves one 50kg shell and that is a common in task factory manufacturing. And in case of failure, manaul override is also much faster.

So what looks fragile and error prone to you could easily be even more robust due to lower weight moved and  industry proven parts instead of custom made special parts (which Industry moves 3000kg on a belt?).

And also - what I heard common artillery needs a barrel change every 3000 shots. And the PzH-2000 shoots on average 300 shots a day.

>	a third party arresting a Russian diplomat on grounds connected to the war is an active involvement in the war.

This is a very good point, and I agree on the weirdness of involvement, but (not to deflect entirely) that also is more fundamental to my overall 'argument' over the entire conflict.  Precedent is either undefined or just completely arbitrary.

The idea that this very open proxy war is truly any different than direct NATO involvement is baffling.  Poland (and the rest of NATO+) is already involved, Iran is certainly involved, perhaps directly, and all the proxying is doing is getting more people killed by making the conflict drag on longer, because there's no middle ground end-game.  Russia couldn't dream of holding ground against NATO proper, so either Russia eventually withdraws, or it resorts to the only real weapons it has and we end up in nuclear war.

As for pro-russia people, I certainly don't care about placating them as they aren't worth consideration in any international diplomacy, and I honestly think you're overestimating their numbers.  Plus, the more they talk, the easier they are to find and investigate for treason.  If they're just willfully ignorant or victims of propaganda, that's a social issue to be dealt with in other ways.  But then I'm also one of those wackos that thinks the FCC should be given the power to regulate cable and streaming, and shut certain programs down unless they comply with the Fairness Doctrine."

I don't know if he was shooting the surrendering soldiers (there's been lots of reports of this, right?) or the Ukrainians.

I don't know if it turned into a protracted firefight and he leapt behind his comrades for cover (if he cared about their safety he wouldn't have launched his suicide attack right next to them).

I don't know if the Ukrainians killed him and then executed each and every one of his comrades in cold blood.

Ukraine problem is mostly the lack of heavy equipment to outfit the offenseive forces. That's why there is a time between counter offensive operations, mostly to gather enough reserves in equipment that come in and of course every offensive will have loss of equipment.

What was once the most important exchange forum between German and Russian civil society, the Petersburg Dialogue, will apparently be dissolved for good.

""At the request of the board of directors, the general meeting of the Petersburg Dialogue decides to hold another extraordinary general meeting in the 1st quarter of 2023, in which the dissolution of the Petersburg Dialogue is to be decided,"" reads a letter obtained by SPIEGEL. The dissolution was decided at a meeting on Friday and is to be brought to the General Assembly on Nov. 22.

Vladimir Putin and Gerhard Schrder had founded the association in 2000 to promote exchange between civil society and the media on the German and Russian sides. Once a year, journalists, diplomats, scientists, artists, business representatives and politicians from different parties meet in Germany or Russia - the last time was about three years ago in Bonn. Since Nawalny's poisoning and the Ukraine war, the event was no longer held and the forum increasingly developed into a soliloquy.

The Petersburg Dialogue was funded by foundations, the business community and the German Foreign Office, but became increasingly less important as German-Russian relations deteriorated. From 2015 until the end, the head of the forum was Merkel's former chancellor's office chief Roland Pofalla (CDU). According to SPIEGEL information, several members of the Petersburg Dialogue had already signaled that they would no longer be available before the now threatened dissolution."

You seem to lack an understanding of democracy. You see, democracy only works when both sides operate in good faith. As you note, doing ""what they believe is best for the country"". Except that's not what Republicans do at all. Their platform has no positive project, no policy or plan that would actually constitute doing what's best for the country. Their platform is to destroy anything Democrats do good or bad, deregulate industries (which is guaranteed to be disastrous), regulate personal lives (so much for freedom), and end democratic egalitarianism.

You're protecting Republicans under a system they actively oppose and seek to destroy. If they want to act in good faith, they're welcome to change their platform. As it stands, they're Christofascists who offer little else than authoritarian bluster.

See you can have free trade with a country that adheres to the same rules and principles, China isn't a country like that.

So for me complete protectionism of critical infrastructure and industries and layered protectionism depending per country is a wise move forwards, even the playing field for domestic companies by enforcing huge tariffs on Chinese crap, I mean, Italy used to be the cheap crap vendor of Europe until the Chinese undercut their industry, there is no reason why another European country couldn't be the Cheap crap manufacturer again, keeping industry within the confines of the continent will allow poorer countries to flourish and grow more swiftly."

The outcome of the war in Ukraine will be one of the factors determining the security situation in the world in the 21st century.  
  
As Censor.NET informs, this was reported by RBC-Ukraine with reference to the statement of US Defense Minister Lloyd Austin during the International Security Forum in Halifax.  
  
""The results of the war in Ukraine will help determine the course of global security in this century,"" he said.  
  
Austin also claimed that NATO is a defensive alliance and does not seek confrontation with Russia, does not pose a threat to it.  
  
""But we will not be drawn into the war. We will support Ukraine,"" said the head of the Pentagon.  
  
Austin added that the US will defend every inch of NATO territory and continue to strengthen the alliance's collective defenses.

With a Statement like that its clear the US/NATO is fully backing a UA win, without giving either putin or xi the opportunity to blame NATO as both like to. the downside to this is that to ensure Non participation the escalation of weapon supplies has to be proportional, which leads to lives lost for UA, in my view  borderline immoral, but from a geo-political view which those leaders are forced to be led by understandable."

He agreed to pull US forces out of afghanistan on condition that (1) they didn't attack western forces and (2) they engaged with afghan gov on a peace deal.  While they did the former part of that, the latter part of deal was not only not honored, but they infiltrated areas as US forces pulled back, did all sorts of attacks on govt forces & assassinated lots of govt admin officials.  Trump kept up with the 'withdrawal' despite his conditions not being met, but that's totally not a surrender.  Okay, so russia should do an withdrawal where ukraine doesn't attack the retreating forces and there are no other conditions Ukraine has to  honor...

Who cares what the perspective of russia is on the sovereignty of ukraine?  That's the point here, they don't get to dictate the sovereignty of 50 million people because they think they should be subservient to Russia.  Ukraine was a distinct republic within USSR just like Russia was.  Its territory was recognized under the USSR constitution, as was its right as a state in its own right (e.g., it was founding member of the UN).  The dissolution of USSR, Ukraine was as much an independent state as Russia was, and this was effected with the consent of all involved.  Not only that, Russia agreed to secruity assurances and to respect Ukraine's territorial integrity & independence in an explicit treaty.  To say that Russia views some or all of Ukraine as its own territory speaks to how pointless it would be for Ukraine to negotiate anything with Russia other than its complete withdrawal from Ukrainian territory.

You're missing the point.  If Ukraine doesn't hold substantially all of its territory at the end of this, it will be forced to either concede that in perpetuity, or will be significantly impeded from making defensive alliances.  Russia can re-arm as much as it wants if Ukraine gets all of its land back, because Ukraine will then be able to enter defensive treaties with western allies.  And no, Ukraine doesn't need a peace deal with Russia to do these, it just needs to be able to credibly assure allies that it won't engage in any aggression against russian territory.  so long as russia occupies ukrainian territory, those types of assurances may not be credible.

If nuclear weapons were as simple as destroy the entire world or not use them, there would be no discussion or threat about their use here.  Using tactical nukes would be decisive against Ukraine in the current war, unless Nato would be willing to enter the war.  If Russia thereafter used tactical nukes on Nato forces, then you're in the realm of nuclear escalation.  But imho there is little reason to fear that, because using a nuke would not meet any of Russia's aims.  It is hard to imagine a more cowardly act and of course even China wouldn't stand for it, nor would India continue to engage with Russia.  Putin and his cronies haven't stolen billions from russians in order to become north korea part deux."

I mean there must be a systematic problem in planning.  How is it possible to delay a decision such a long time? An instruction has been missing cuz it was possible. It seems that setting ultimate deadlines, which is standard in business, could have prevented this planning error.

Remember, we heard yesterday (or the day before) that the Russian political elite thinks this will end with Zelenskyy resigning his post. This is likely part of the plan - terrorize the Ukrainian people until Zelenskyy has no choice but to step aside and a Kremlin-friendly puppet is installed.

There has never been any ""iron-clad guarantees"". It was much less ""iron-clad"" than for example Budapest memorandum that Russia broke as soon as it was inconvenient for them. It actually never even existed, it was just pipe-dream.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/09/us/politics/russia-ukraine-james-baker.html

While there was indeed discussion between Mr. Baker and the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the months after the fall of the Berlin Wall about limiting NATO jurisdiction if East and West Germany were reunited, no such provision was included in the final treaty signed by the Americans, Europeans and Russians.

The bottom line is, thats a ridiculous argument, Mr. Baker said in an interview in 2014, a few months after Russia seized Crimea and intervened in eastern Ukraine. It is true that in the initial stages of negotiations I said what if and then Gorbachev himself supported a solution that extended the border that included the German Democratic Republic, or East Germany, within NATO. Since the Russians signed that treaty, he asked, how can they rely on something I said a month or so before? It just doesnt make sense.

https://hls.harvard.edu/today/there-was-no-promise-not-to-enlarge-nato/

Zoellick vividly recalls the White House meeting he attended nearly three decades ago in which Bush asked Gorbachev if he agreed with the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe principle that nations are free to ally with others as they see fit. When Gorbachev said yes, he says, the Soviet leaders own colleagues at the table visibly separated themselves."

They have 2-3 carriers continuously deployed but a lot of the times just pass through the Med on the way to Indian Ocean or Persian Gulf.  Its not unusual to see a U.S. carrier passing through the Med but its unusual to see two of them at the same time.  

Also highly unusual to see simultaneous deployments of the European carriers.  While they are, of course, all in Europe, they usually reside in their home ports and venture out to make a show of force or participate in humanitarian missions.  The QE in particular is usually in Britain.

More importantly than having all those carriers active in the Med (which is already kinda crazy) is having the baddest (bestest) ship from each navy active in the same area at the same time.  The QE is the pride of the British Fleet, same with the De Gaulle to the French and the Cavour to the Italians.  For each of those countries they have deployed their largest military vessel.  The U.S. has deployed the Gerald Ford, for which the newest class of carriers is named and is basically the pride of its fleet and the largest of the 11 U.S. carriers, as well as the GHWB which is one of the most modern Nimitz-class carriers (having been built last).

Each of these countries has put their greatest Naval military asset out to sea (ready for combat).  That is not the usual state of affairs, even for a major military exercise.  

As a note: it further emphasizes (to Russia) how far they have fallen as a naval power.  They sold one Kusnetsov-class carrier, a fire broke out on the other, their navy is no longer capable of fielding carriers basically.  A major point of contention in the Russo-Ukrainian War was the port of Sevastopol in Crimea.  A primary reason to seize this from Ukraine was so Russia could regain the only ice-free deep water port the USSR had.  All these NATO countries rolling around with their carriers is not only an impressive display of displacement and force, but also a big fuck you to a country that longs for power projection."

*****
> The audit, which will examine funds allocated by the Joe Biden administration to Kyiv, will begin in January 2023, when Republicans take their seats in the House of Representatives.

> Republicans have been divided on the issue for months, with Kevin McCarthy&#039;s camp in favor of reviewing aid to Kyiv and Mitch McConnell&#039;s in favor of additional aid to Ukraine.

> Green referred to remarks by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who earlier said Republicans would not send a &quot;Blank check&quot; to Ukraine in response to criticism in his party over US aid.

Zelenskys defiant address set the tone for the conference in Halifax, a major annual gathering that brings together key officials from democratic nations and activists seeking a democratic future for their countries.

The gathering this year is focused on Russias invasion of Ukraine and its aftermath, with conference documents and paraphernalia adorned in Ukraines national colors of yellow and blue.

Russia will find no sympathy here, as Western and current and former Ukrainian officials will discuss in public and in private how best to aid Kyiv in its moment of need.

Those conversations will now be impacted by Zelenskyys clarion call for continued resistance to Russia, even if Moscow wants a break.

Peace is possible, Zelenskyy said, but for it to exist, we must make impossible Russian aggression [in] all of its elements. Let it happen. Let there be peace.

Ending Russian aggression makes peace possible.

Let it be so.

Garry Kasparov agrees entirely: 

Dictators do not stop until they are stopped.

From there imagine him ready to go against the power in place, there is only one step.

*Yevgeny Prigozhin and Kadyrov are the force that will rule Russia after Putin*, wants to believe Alfred Koch, a former deputy prime minister of Boris Yeltsin, now in exile. *And Putin is alive and well only until this couple feels stronger than the army. As soon as that happens, they will have in their hands a snuffbox and a scarf \[a reference to the assassination of Czar Paul I in 1801\] and they will immediately arrive in Putins apartments.*

Regardless of the seriousness of this prediction, Yevgeny Prigozhins rise is indeed causing significant resentment within the Russian military, not to mention the tenacious hatred he has for many FSB agents, the Russian security services, and the fear he arouses among the elite.

However, his posture remains very opportune for power. Such profiles have always existed during Vladimir Putins reign  radicals whose very existence is supposed to reassure, both internally and externally, the moderate position of the president. These characters, like Vladimir Zhirinovsky (historical leader of the ultranationalist party LDPR, who died in April 2022), were content to vociferate their fantasies of nuclear war on television.

Europe alone has more men, tanks, ships, artillery and aircraft than Russia does.

1) the hardliners who have been asking for it, but have no concept of reality have pushed for it.

He is just about to survive and pocket as much money as possible. In no form do I want to defend Orban, he is the scum of the earth and he makes me hate my country. I moved away from Hungary but every day when I check the news I have a tight stomach because I know he will do something even more disgraceful and he is willing to sink much-much lower. But for me, it seems that Putin has something on him. Because he tends to make favors toward Putin and his allies even when those are illogical. In no way do I want to bring in conspiracy theories or anything. But in Hungary, after the end of communism, the agent files never were published. Which are a disgrace and a huge liability because those who had access could blackmail many people. Maybe this, or something totally different is in the background. But Orban was against the Soviet Union heavily and the turn he made at the time he made didn't seem logical. 

In no form, I can imagine that he would want actual land from Ukraine. Hungarian military is a joke and he knows that too. Also, those parts of Ukraine are one of the poorest. Hungary already suffering in many ways. He just likes to be relevant and that's why he shows gestures to the far right. Currently, he has the uneducated mass which is fueled with propaganda, and the far right which is 1/3 of the country, but it's enough to grant him absolute power. 

Also, Orban always worked in the EU as the bad guy but there were many cases when certain EU members wanted him to take the blame instead of them. In public, they could tell what they wanted about Orban, but always maintained his power and made many deals with him like Merkel did. Obviously, this is not relevant to this news,  but I would be curious to see that does this voices still exist or if he just actually believes that he is so big that he can do whatever he wants. I really hope the EU stops messing around and finds ways to screw him. But since they are actually negotiating with him about the delayed funds shows me that the EU is still not radical enough. We can't expect that he will fail by election or any form of revolution. Hungarian as a nation was beaten down so many times that people live in apathy and many people still do not understand democracy and how should that work. The transition to a democratic system wasn't something all of Hungary fought for. It wasn't earned, it was given because of other events. Therefore we are fucked and I hope the EU and NATO won't tolerate it any longer."

No, that talking point is based on semantic gaslighting.  They may discuss the specifics of CRT in law school, but the ideology of CRT has altered the curriculum which now incorporates basic aspects of CRT.  Anyone that paid any attention is keenly aware of the changing narrative that occurred, from ""it's not being taught"" to ""it's being taught but it's just discussing race"" to ""it's just being honest about the past and impact on today"" back to ""it's not being taught"".

1. She was not trying to ""smuggle drugs into Russia"", she was already in Russia and attempting to fly out of Sheremetyevo airport near Moscow.
2. The amount of hashish oil she allegedly had in her bags was a very small amount, certainly not more than enough for personal consumption. It was in a bottle smaller than the amount of shampoo you're allowed in a carryon in the US.
3. The Russian judicial system is incentivized to give her the maximum penalty for political reasons. She is less likely to be punished for what she did, but instead who she is.
4. This was a fairly regular trip for her, as she and another WNBA player had done so multiple years in a row.
5. The Russian government has been known to use US Citizens in political stunts.

Because of these factors, it seems that the majority of her situation was caused not by her actions but by the political situation. This is why I think it is the responsibility of the US government to intervene on her behalf and get her back to US soil."

Ah, so you don't know what ad hominem is. I thought as much.

""Ad hominem"" and ""insult"" are not synonymous, much as internet debate school may have taught you otherwise. Saying someone is a moron for making terrible arguments isn't (necessarily) an ad hominem argument.

Ad hominem is when you say someone is wrong because of something about them as a person, as opposed to some flaw in their argument. Hence the name - ad hominem is Latin for ""to the person"". For instance, say that you argued that Elon Musk was a genius businessman and I argued that you are wrong, citing his recent fumbling of Twitter as evidence. If you called me ""dunce"" - which appears to be the only insult you know - and said that I'm wrong because SpaceX and Tesla were great business ventures, that's not an ad hominem attack, even though it contains an insult. On the other hand, if you very politely say that I have no idea what I'm talking about because I'm not a billionaire businessman and therefore cannot comprehend Musk's genius, that \*is\* an ad hominem, even though there's no insult, because the veracity or lack thereof of an argument has absolutely nothing to do with who is making it, meaning the fact I'm not a billionaire is immaterial.

Thing that both you and the article are missing, however, is that that doesn't mean that the lack of scientific output \*caused\* that end to the Golden Age.

In this specific case, there's a number of pretty easy-to-spot causes that resulted in both scientific decline AND the end of the Golden Era - specifically that all those Arabic nations that had been busily churning out scientific and cultural advancements over the last few hundred years suddenly found themselves in the midst of a series of military conflicts that rather dramatically shifted their priorities, culminating in the destruction of one of the most central and important cities of the medieval era.

I wouldn't think this is that difficult of a concept to understand."

I do wish the west, not just Germany, would do more, but at the end of the day, there is always the realpolitik that gets in the way of doing what is right. We might not like it, but all we can do is push our respective governments to do more.

I'm in Georgia, and there are regular protests outside the parliament in Tbilisi with people demanding the government take certain actions, but the government has its Russian supporters in it, and from what i see (being an expat, so not fully clear about the situation, getting most info from Georgian friends) it will have to wait for elections before there is a chance of change.

And yeah, considering what has happened to Georgia (twice) you might be gobsmacked that there could be Russian supporters in government, but Russia has spent decades influencing its neighbours and there are those who fear Russia and don't want to upset it, as though appeasement has ever worked in the long run!"

There were polls for everything you want, especially in the 90s. You could buy any result. Nevertheless, I'm skeptical of the claim.

>Also those 1987 protests, why didn't they go anywhere?

Brutal repression. 

>They were protesting because they wanted more food or stuff, they didn't give a shit about freedom and ideology

That's BS. Freedom, ideology, and politics were discussed by most if not all Romanians. Discussing the political situation, and its implications, was typical and was done in every situation in which people felt safe to do it. Political jokes were omnipresent and sometimes even got through censorship (see Toma Caragiu).

Many people tried to get info from outside and listen to Radio Free Europe, and Voice of America.

>you can't say that everyone considered him a puppet of the soviets from the beginning

Ceausescu was never considered a puppet of the soviets, neither by the majority of Romanians nor by people outside of Romania who understood something about the situation.

>The soviets didn't help Iliescu in any way, but he was affiliated with them

That's a myth. Actually, this a myth probably created by the regime itself, as Ceausescu was not ""pro-soviets"", so if you want to discredit somebody, that was how you do it.

There is no proof he was an ""agent"". Iliescu had initially a good career in the party, almost too good. Ceausescu, and not only him, did not want to have people capable of replacing them, so he was sidelined. If they would have had any proof for him to be a soviet agent, he would have had a ""tragic"" accident. 

How the hell was he ""representing"" or affiliated with the Soviets when during the 80s at least, probably longer, he was under quite intense surveillance by the Securitate? The guy had always somebody on him, 24h per day, 7 days per week, and probably had more bugs in his house than an entomologist!"

As of this point, power to major population centers has been restored within days after each attack.

It is one thing to knock out power in preparation for an impending attack, but it is a completely different undertaking to attempt to destroy the electrical system country-wide.

This is partially because the electrical system is overbuilt for peak demand. At least in North America, every house and apartment has a power hookup for people to cook, blowdry their hair, have an AC running, and boil water for tea, _simultaneously_.

So if the russians destroy the big transformer, the Ukrainian engineers can lower the line voltage, hook up a smaller transformer, and tell people to save energy by only using devices they absolutely need. And I believe that's what's happening.

In the end, an average household might have a 6-kVA hookup, but only needs 100W for LED light bulbs to light a home. and maybe 1kW of power to prevent the water lines from freezing (if heat is electric, which is not very common in Europe anyway.

Pump stations for water and sewage all have their own backup generator, at least where I live.

In order to bring down the electricity grid, russia would need to destroy a lot of electrical transmission towers, and even then Ukraine would probably improvise, convert long-distance power lines to High-voltage-DC, and run them underground.

You can get a general idea from the Kiel Institute's Ukraine Support Tracker. Currently states around $15.2B in financial aid to Ukraine (compared to $27.6B in military and $9.5B in humanitarian aid).

In fact, I'd argue that this aid is of even more critical importance than the military aid. Putin, having failed with direct military attacks, has shifted to economic warfare hoping to bankrupt the Ukrainian state. This is actually an area where the White House has criticized the European allies for not acting fast enough. While the Biden administration has been quick to provide this critical aid, the Europeans have promised a lot of cash but provided very little of it to date. While I can understand some EU countries being unwilling or unable to provide military assistance, there's really no excuse for them not providing financial assistance.

That said, I am one of those ""crazy"" republicans who is very concerned about how this money is spent. I have seen no evidence of any wrongdoing and believe we should ramp up assistance in coordination with our allies, but I do believe we should take a hard look and make sure to have clear controls. Corruption is not an unknown problem, and it should be relatively straightforward (though certainly not easy) problem to solve. 

It's been over 6 months that the US has been supplying aid, we should have had time to setup such systems. In fact the US recently announced that they were able to convert Ukraine over to an inventory tracking system to help better track where the various military equipment goes. I personally have faith that the Biden administration is doing a good job with this, but I can totally understand why some people might be critical of this. The US government is not a paragon of anti-corruption itself.

That said, I'm not blind to the fact that some republicans like MTG and Trump are simply using this excuse for some alternate agenda. This complicates the very (in my opinion) legitimate argument on tracking aid."

Do you suppose that Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltics declared independence because the Russians were so kind to them? Or that the Ukrainians had to overthrow Russian installed regimes twice because the Russians had their best interests in mind? Or that the Belarussians took to the streets last year because they loved Putin's lickspittle so much? Or that the Dagestanis or the Chechans love being under Putin's boot?

You are trying to justify Russian imperialism of the present by pointing at the imperialism of the past. Russia is ***right now*** easing child labor laws because Putin's government has spent the past two decades running the population into the dirt, and made the problem even worse by getting a lot of the working age population killed and is sending many more to get killed. ***Right now*** the Russians are bombarding power plants to try and freeze an entire country into submission, are trying to engineer a both a food and energy crisis globally to try to convince the world to just let them have a country they couldn't take by force.

You are in fact trying to justify Russia making the Ukrainians suffer. That is the argument you are making. What you are saying is Russia is justified in what it is doing because NATO didn't do what it wanted. You're just too intellectually cowardly to see that is what you're saying. You're also factually wrong because NATO stonewalled Ukraine on membership for years specifically to appease Russia and the Russians still attacked Ukraine. Twice.

No one attacked Russia. NATO didn't have more than a token force in Eastern Europe before Russia kicked off this war. It didn't even have token forces there until Russia started trying to take chunks out of its neighbor. So in every respect, factually and ethically, you are dead wrong. You have no point whatsoever.

In that case, Europe (and especially Eastern Europe) might not able to handle such a big influx considering they are in midst of recession (and winter).

The only reason Ukraine has not been given ATACMS is because of Biden's National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan. He's the one who's consistently killed it due to some concerns Ukraine might strike Moscow. But keep in mind that for some time it seemed like Ukraine would've even get HIMARS... and now they have 30 of 'em. 

Anyways it's not clear that a long range precision strike weapon will really help Ukraine *that much*. It would let them strike deeper into the Russian rear but they can already do that pretty well. I suspect that Ukraine would much rather have more mortar vehicles,  more GPS-guided Excalibur artillery, and more armored vehicles (tanks and transports) and of course more air defense.

Wagner's guys are mercenaries - they have no loyalty to him personally. And their actual numbers are far too small to match any of Russia's agencies. The Federal Guard Service alone outnumbers them, let alone Rosgvardiya, the ordinary police, FSB forces, the armed civil defense forces of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, and of course the regular armed forces.

Putin has use for Prigozhin because he thinks he 'gets stuff done' and isn't afraid to get his hands dirty, while not posing any real threat to Putin. He comes from the criminal world, not the political one or military or security services. 

As such he's got zero support in those circles. On the contrary the hate him. Besides the natural hatred that'd come in any situation where some outsider with no experience comes along and tries to convince your boss he can do your job better than you can, the Wagner guys have on occasion murdered Russian soldiers, murdered FSB guys. They know it, even if it's all been quietly 'dealt with'. 

To Putin that's all 'a feature, not a bug'. It means Prigozhin is totally dependent on Putin for his position. (and officially he has none at all, he's got no title, no Kremlin job, he's just a government contractor) On top of which you have the usual criteria for getting to the top, namely being corrupt. Prigozhin's entire wealth has been based off bribes and kickbacks with government contracts for his catering business. Like the rest of the Kremlin, he can easily be thrown into prison at any time on corruption charges without even needing to fabricate a case.

Prigozhin has a big mouth and loves media attention. But Russia is not a Western country where you can convert media attention into real political power. All power is with Putin. If he wants you in jail, or merely silenced, it'll happen instantly. 

That's not to say Prigozhin (like the rest of them) isn't constantly seeking to expand his power and influence. But this stuff is more of a charade for a one-man-audience, an attempt to convince Putin he'd be a suitable successor. Because Putin anointing him as successor is Prigozhin's only real shot at getting power. He's got no supporters anywhere else."

The reason Lukashenko is Putin's lickspittle is because his own people don't want him and the only reason he's hung on is due to Putin's support.

Those MiGs will then be going to Ukrain. Supplying Ukrain with F16s directly will not be useful for several reasons. 

The main ones is that Ukrain does not have airfield infrastructure that will support the landing, takeoff and maintenance requirements and they will need to be a NATO member to keep their planes flying if they ever get in a war, since their own airfields will be bombed to bits and all they can do is evacuate their aircraft.

The second reason is that they currently have no pilots that can be quickly trained to fly the F16 competitively. 

The Gripen does not have the first problem, but it does suffer the second one.

Given these circumstances, there are a lot of good arguments to get them MiG right now and the Gripen will probably be the better choice for the ""near future"" once they can get their pilots trained and aircraft become available. I saw someone comment that South Africa has a bunch of them and can't afford them really.

Even now ukraine cannot provide adequate logistics for pzh 2000 and everytime it breaks down, they have to haul it other way to Lithuania (not a reflection on the ukrainians but rather how complex and difficult the task is).  

The thing uniquely about tanks is that the logistical hub has to be so close to the front line,  which introduce another point of vulnerability for war planners.  It will only be worth the risk if ukraine has a significant amount of tanks or else you just end up allocating forces to provide air cover/counter battery for a logistical train that doesn't provide enough offset in strategic value.  

Best way is to have things in place that can handle a significant amount of tanks, then receive a small patch for tryout immediately followed by a larger number.

Like Hitler with a handful of tanks in 1937, Putin's nuclear threat is probably a bluff. He has had no money to maintain his missiles. If he orders an ICBM to launch, the odds are it will fail on the launch pad, or the warhead will be a dud. But if he orders all 6000 of his nukes launched, probably 20 of them will work, and that is enough to cause A Very Bad Day.

If the Ukraine War goes on for another year, the Russian state will collapse, and the West can buy the nukes from the new warlords who take over the remnants of the Russian Federation.

Lobbing some missiles every week is the only thing they can do, and those missiles are essentially terror weapons. They do not change anything on the battlefield, most of them are being shot down, and the damage they do is being repaired in a few days.

It would be a mistake to change focus from liberating territory to revenge efforts for the missile strikes. For every civilian killed by the missiles, the UAF kills hundreds of ill-equipped mobiks every day.

In WWII, Britain was being bombed constantly with hundreds of tons of explosives every night, yet the population was only more resolved to resist the Nazis. And russia doesn't have the firepower to actually level a city in Ukraine, nukes aside.

The power grid can be decentralized and hardened if that needs to be done. With the current resources and resolve of the UAF, russia can be defeated on the battlefield. The missiles are just a distraction, effective, but not war-winning."

Ukraine has had successful offensives at the rate of about one every few months or so. Massive effort, followed by entrenchment. They don't need many, maybe one more, if they can erase all the Russian gains in Zaphorizhia oblast, but that would be a BIG offensive. If that happens, Russia would be back close to where they were at the start of the war with Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.

I'd say it's no concern for Ukraine in the near future. Although the uncomfortable truth is more questions will be raised the longer the war goes on. Especially if the EU doesn't come to agreement on larger aid packages for Ukraine.

I don't think it's going to be a large issue until 2024 due to the elections. I imagine it will be a topic in Republican presidential primaries. How much traction it will get will probably depend on how it polls among likely voters. 

Hopefully Ukraine has wrapped things up by then. If not, and assuming this becomes and issue in Congress, there is still Lend Lease waiting in the wings precisely for this, it was pushed through early on in the war and gives the President the ability to give US military equipment to Ukraine without Congressional authorization. Without funding that too would run out of steam eventually (the US isn't going to empty it's strategic reserves) but hopefully a few years into the future this war is either over or at such a low intensity that it's not an issue anymore for Ukraine to pull their own weight."

India buys it's oil from wherever it can because we want to bridge the energy gap untill Green Hydrogen becomes cheap and scalable. So if you cannot understand India's diplomatic policies that's ok. Doesn't give you the right to demonize it based on it's attempt to protect itself and its citizens."

There is a theory that the revolution started when they aired the TV series Dallas on romanian national TV and everyone saw how rich the americans were, more of a joke.

The people in the 60s and 70s, the good ol times of Ceausescu's rule first of all many didn't even have TVs, they lived in the countryside and had to get on a waiting list for a few years to be able to buy a gas stove, for example. I guarantee those people didn't give a shit. And the people who were moved to the cities also couldn't complain, since it was a big upgrade and living conditions were ok. Shit started to hit the fan in the 80s and they would start rationing electricity and food, not even because they didn't have any, they had more than we do now, just because of Ceausescu's stupid idea of paying off his debt to the western countries (which he used to build the factories), because he didn't understand economics and wanted to be INDEPENDENT even of the west for political reasons.

Anyway I am not saying it was good, just rejecting the notion that it was a ""soviet puppet state"", and Ceausescu went away because he lost soviet support. It was not, it was much more like North Korea. Is North Korea a soviet puppet state? Well the soviets don't exist anymore but North Korea keeps chugging along.

It's horrible what's happening in Ukraine but to sit there and comment on something that's so large, complex and intersectional with a massive population is not just armchair activits crap but also completely misinformed.
Despite being the largest democracy of the world Ukraine has repeatedly voted against India getting veto power in the UN. Why? What has India ever done to Ukraine? Absolutely nothing.
India buys it's oil from wherever it can because we want to bridge the energy gap untill Green Hydrogen becomes cheap and scalable. So if you cannot understand India's diplomatic policies that's ok. Doesn't give you the right to demonize it based on it's attempt to protect itself and its citizens."

There is a theory that the revolution started when they aired the TV series Dallas on romanian national TV and everyone saw how rich the americans were, more of a joke.

The people in the 60s and 70s, the good ol times of Ceausescu's rule first of all many didn't even have TVs, they lived in the countryside and had to get on a waiting list for a few years to be able to buy a gas stove, for example. I guarantee those people didn't give a shit. And the people who were moved to the cities also couldn't complain, since it was a big upgrade and living conditions were ok. Shit started to hit the fan in the 80s and they would start rationing electricity and food, not even because they didn't have any, they had more than we do now, just because of Ceausescu's stupid idea of paying off his debt to the western countries (which he used to build the factories), because he didn't understand economics and wanted to be INDEPENDENT even of the west for political reasons.

Anyway I am not saying it was good, just rejecting the notion that it was a ""soviet puppet state"", and Ceausescu went away because he lost soviet support. It was not, it was much more like North Korea. Is North Korea a soviet puppet state? Well the soviets don't exist anymore but North Korea keeps chugging along. Just trying to explain it because people have really simplistic and wrong understanding of the thing."

While most Russians will not be OK with the inevitable slaughter that will accompany full mobilization, it's a total uncertainty if they are able to meaningfully resist it.

Also worth mentioning that proper history teachers point out to students that the Hungarian tribes that took control of the area did not go around on a genocidal rampage but the people living here assimilated naturally over time giving us a very diverse geenepool (pretty sure I mistyped that word). Also pointing out that this meant cultures molding together over time. A switch to Christianity also rapidly followed.

Give it a day or 2 and someone will either say Ukraine needs to negotiate OR someone will say Ukraine needs to negotiate on its own terms.

While the latter part of that is true, bringing it up constantly is due to pressure for Ukraine to negotiate and whoever is saying that is trying to reiterate that.

Hungary at the moment has a culture of looking to the past, of reminiscing over what was once their great empire and their loss at the Trianon convention. Hungary are part of the EU but never really successfully caught on with exports and realizing opportunities trough trade and cooperations abroad. There are some minor exceptions like Budapest Tourism, the pronindustry  and WIzzAir. But if you travel to places like Debrecen, Nyigheraza etc you see they re staying behind, especially the smaller villages and cities surrounding them.

To give you an example when ordering a trainticket to Ukraine from Debrecen the person behind the counter still had to handwrite the details on the ticket.When entering the tourist information  of Debrecen  the second city of Hungary  people working there didnt speak English,solely Russian and Hungarian. Thisis a reflection of howislated their worlds are. Hungary in general has the lowest speaking part of people able to speak English. The main reason having no interest in the outside world. Except for the more modern Budapest.

If you take a country like Ukraine they are taking big steps lately. Saw kids of seven that were already thaught English at school.

However, they ""offered"" to deliver gas via NS2, which would have been a diplomatic and strategic victory for Russia, because it would have meant that Germany would have to revoke its decision not to open NS2, and this would have been a crack in the system of European sanctions against russia. 

Under these circumstances, it totally makes sense for russia to blow up NordStream 1 (the one which was officially still in service) because then the only alternative for Germany to get gas would have been NS2. 

The russians bet on supply problems in Europe and generally overestimated european reliance on russian gas. Their gambling didn't pay off. 

And someone else mentioned that the explosions happened just a couple of days before a norwegian-polish gas pipeline was opened - and the pipes run just a few kilometres from the point where NS1 was sabotaged. This could also be interpreted as a silent ""nod"" to the norwegians and poles to remind them that their pipelines are not secure and can be destroyed at any moment. 

&#x200B;

On the other hand: Why would the US want to blow up a pipeline which isn't transporting gas, but which belongs to an allied nation? This would not lead to a single dollar of extra revenue, but the political fallout would be utterly desastrous if it came to light."

Traces of explosives have been found at the site of the damaged Nord Stream pipelines, a Swedish prosecutor has said.  
  
Last month, a preliminary investigation of damage on the two Nord Stream gas pipelines in the Danish part of the Baltic Sea showed the leaks were caused by ""powerful explosions"".  
  
The findings were similar to those of Swedish prosecutors, who said two other holes in the pipelines also seemed to have been caused by deliberate subsea blasts and the case was investigated as an act of gross sabotage.  
  
Confirming that sabotage had taken place, the Swedish Prosecution Authority said in a statement: ""Analysis that has now been carried out shows traces of explosives on several of the objects that were recovered.""  
  
They added: ""The investigation is highly complex and comprehensive. The ongoing probe will determine whether any suspects can be identified.""  
  
The four leaks in the pipelines, which link Russia and Germany via the Baltic Sea, have become a flashpoint in the Ukraine crisis.  
  
The leaks occurred in international waters but within the exclusive economic zone of Denmark and Sweden.  
  
The damaged Nord Stream pipelines discharged huge amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into the air for several days."

No one did, not even those who previously served, or currently *run* that military. The only ones who knew were the ones who would be *extremely* punished should they speak out about it. Not to mention lying about things like military standards to pass inspection is so culturally embedded, they actually have two different words for lying.

vranyo is a lie that is told for a specific purpose, but everyone (at least everyone in-the-know) knows it's false. Like if you're my commander, and you know I'm a mess, but still report I'm in top shape. We both know you're lying, but we also both know we get punished if you didn't lie.

At least, that's my understanding. Russia's going to need a lot of help/support after all of this is over if we want to move away from them getting caught up in this stuff.

Before he was president he borrowed money from Russia when US banks cut him off (cuz hes a fraud) and was aided by Russian interference in our elections. Oh yeah, and he incited a violent mob to overthrow our government because he didnt want to give up power after he lost by over 7 million votes. I dont think he the devil, but I think hes showed he has loopholes in his scruples and hes not interested in what is best for his country, he is out for himself .

Also, Zelensky is the reason Ukraine is still standing under its own volition. He was offered safe evacuation by foreign powers and famously responded I dont need a ride I need ammo.  This was nearly 9 months ago and Ukraine is still standing (and winning). Russian bombing of infrastructure and civilian population centers, and blockade on Ukrainian grain exports, and sham annexation referendums have weakened Ukraines economy, not Zelenskys policies.

Depending on how high that number of people who don't return is, Russia's economy could just spiral downwards forever at this point. Even before the invasion in February, Russia's population was declining, and having a lot of young people either dying on the front line or getting out of dodge will only speed that up.

 >Battleship Potemkin (Russian:  , Bronenosets Potyomkin), sometimes rendered as Battleship Potyomkin, is a 1925 Soviet silent  drama film produced by Mosfilm. Directed and co-written by Sergei Eisenstein, it presents a dramatization of the mutiny that occurred in 1905 when the crew of the Russian battleship Potemkin rebelled against its officers. In 1958, the film was voted number 1 on the prestigious Brussels 12 list at the 1958 World Expo. Battleship Potemkin is considered one of the greatest films of all time.

We tend to forget that turning from a castrated, demilitarized pretend peace continent to a military might capable to carry it's own weight was never going to happen overnight and that status quo was largely the result of US interference I might add.

So I stick with my point that the response to Russia was the responsibility of the US, that's the situation that they created in Europe, as such they failed to preserve their own creation.

Also you have to remember, Europe rising means inevitably that the US will have another pole to compete with, one that is actually as advanced and actually capable to compete, unlike China and Russia, so one could argue it is not in the interests of the US for the EU to become competent, but thats another discussion all together.

Having said that, although I know not everyone will agree, I think theres a chance that that idiot in N Korea will take a chance then, to make his move.

I think, if Im reading the situation correctly, Xi is in approximately the same position as putin is. Justfor some reason, people arent realizing it. 

A perfect storm is happening inside China right now, and no one even needs to lift a finger, because theyre causing their own demise. And by that I largely mean the CCP in its own cocky, arrogant, but ultimately short-sighted view. Its lack of due diligence is coming back to bite them, big time.

Yeah, but the flipside to this is that not every single American who went to fight World War II died there. Most of them came back. There's no guarantee that every single Russian man who left will go back, or even that a majority of them will. It really depends on what the political and economic outlook for Russia looks like at the end of the war. 

Plus, don't forget that Russia is also losing a lot of people at war as well, so the number of people who leave and don't return in order to dodge the draft isn't representative of the entire population loss. At a certain point, the population loss is unsustainable, especially in a country that was already facing demographic decline. 

The other thing to consider here is that the US had a huge economic boom straight after World War II. They still had their manufacturing capabilities while a lot of European countries took years to rebuild their economies. There was also the postwar baby boom, which isn't guaranteed to happen in Russia. 

This isn't going to be the case for Russia. Even if they are able to take and hold large chunks of Ukrainian territory, they're still going to be a heavily sanctioned country for decades. That isn't just a recession, that really could be a spiral. Don't forget that sanctions don't just go away after a year or two, and a lot of the countries currently sanctioned by the West (like North Korea and Venezuela) probably would be wealthy countries otherwise. 

Essentially, they're facing something that isn't just a recession; it could easily be an economic death sentence. I probably was being a bit hyperbolic suggesting the Russian economy is imminently going to spiral, but I think it will happen eventually anyway."

Their other point they use to support their claim is Ukraine's opposition to LGBT and poor treatment of Roma people. 

Support for LGBT in Slavic countries is low across the board, and has always been. The Roma people are also disproportionately disliked across Europe due to their culture.

Sanctions are designed to weaken a state and their capacity to continue doing whatever it is the state(s) issuing sanctions wish them to stop doing. They can be applied to weaken the power of the ruling party yes, but to say their direct application is to undermine their support by fucking the people about is a bit misplaced.. they're usually applied to autocracies and dictatorships, and we're not exactly swimming in examples where sanctions have brought them down. What we do have examples where a state's capacity for harm has been reduced.

China will not 'drop' Russia unless they do something untenable like use nukes, and even then it would only be to avoid heat and potential sanctions from the west.

There is no video that alleges to show Ukrainian's shooting prisoners.

There is one ground-level video of Ukrainians in the process of detaining Russian soldiers as prisoners. One of Russian soldiers, rather than surrender, starts shooting (that's a war crime, perfidy, by the way). Then that video ends, that's all it shows.

Then there is a second video, taken from a drone of the Russian soldiers in the same place and largely in the same positions, but now clearly dead. That's all that video shows.

What happened to the dead soldiers is somewhat unclear. Perhaps they were actually killed by their own fellow soldiers during the firefight. Or (more likely) caught in the crossfire of the fire fight. Or killed by Ukrainians. We don't really know.

Because there is no video of them being killed - CONTRARY TO THE TITLE OF THE THREAD!!!"

A question which is its own answer.

>It's a morally unjust war.

So we become unjust (however small) without any benefit whatsoever for the sake of it?

>Would you consider the exclusion of the Russian Football Federation from FIFA and UEFA competitions as vindictive or a reasonable response?

Sport is used by nations to project their influence (hence Russia buying the world cup in 2018 and having state-sponsored cheating at the Olympics for decades). Expelling Russia denies some of their ability to do this, so it is a perfectly reasonable response in line with the nature of sanctioning in order to weaken a state.

>Gary Kasparov said sanctions should be broader and more generic even if it impacts himself. 

In order to weaken the state, not solely to fuck around individuals who're playing no active part in it at absolutely no benefit to any particular cause.

>The problem you and many others have is trying to apply western ideologies of fairness to Russia.

All you know about me is that I don't believe in doing things for no reason other than spite itself. You've merely said this in an attempt to discredit my opinion rather than make a genuine observation about imposing ideology as understanding the culture of Russia plays no part in my views on this other than knowing it would have *zero* impact on the state or the people's support for Putin. Why diminish ourselves (even slightly) for no reason?

The new aid will help Ukraine pay government salaries, pensions and fund social programs necessary to avoid a worsening of the humanitarian crisis caused by Russia's invasion of its southwestern neighbor.

I think this has been impressed on current leadership but it is quite within the wests capability to tell Russia to knock it off or face real consequences, just as they did countless times during the Cold War.

For all the talk of Democracy on the decline if you average it out Democracy and Free Trade has been well in the lead for raising living standards and human rights. 

The Ukraine war is an example of this- Russia counts only a few basketcase countries as real allies, and even acknowledging the sizeable amount of countries that profess neutrality in the conflict, nearly all comply with broader sanctions to some degree against Russia while steering well clear of actually supplying anything they could use against Ukraine.

> &quot;In this situation, we have every reason to reconsider our arrangements,&quot; Brigadier General Jari Tolppanen of the Finnish Border Guard agency told AFP. Some 200 kilometers of the 1,300-kilometre border would be fenced at a cost of around 380 million euros, the border agency said.

Currently, best case scenario is Putin can withdraw and Ukraine will get its areas back. Putin might be humiliated but he can atleast say he got defeated by NATO backed Ukraine and may preserve his seat. Alternatives to Putin arent much different from him, so NATO isnt gaining much from having him replaced. This also means that Russia would be a bit weaker but still stable, which you want for the nation holding the highest number of nuclear weapons (5977 as per latest American estimate)

However, if Ukraine attacks Russian territory, the Russians wont think like Oh no. They attacked us. Let us stop attacking them. They will instead increase the attacks and when soldiers on front realise their home is in danger from NATO backed Ukraine, they will fight with more spirit. Currently, the Russians are lacking that. Injecting it isnt helpful. If Russia goes down the revenge route, it cant stop unless it reaches a very low point or Ukraine is destroyed. Neither is a good scenario since an unstable Russia with that many nuclear weapons would become an existential crisis to the entire world.

Also, Ukraine attacking occupied Ukraine territory will be viewed differently from Ukraine attacking Russian territory. Countries will happily provide resources and weapons for defence but if you want resources to go attack the country with most number of nuclear weapons in their own lands, you will have a hard time getting those."

The US has only given Ukraine 16 HIMARS, and about 20 M270's. They could have given Ukraine 100 HIMARS, and all of the ATACMS it wanted, Tomahawk cruise missiles, along with a 1000 Abrams tanks, F-16's, etc. 

The United States could easily supply enough materiel to crush Russia in a number of months. The reason they don't want to do that is political - and from the viewpoint of world stability, I believe the correct choice. Putin has backed himself into a bad corner where he's stuck, but not panicked. He can't justify nuclear weapons or extreme escalation, but he also just has to suck up the punishment being slowly doled out. Russia's status as a superpower has been seriously diminished, and what is occurring is a brilliant example of how reckless actions of imperialism will not be allowed to continue unabated.

So it's as much a ""don't say straight"" as ""don't say gay"".  As a gay man, I'm offended for my sister-in-law who can't say she is straight... You're massively projecting, it's all projection.

>desantis and the Florida legislature still have not divested nearly $200 million of Florida's pension fund that is in Russian assets. He has failed to address this money laundering to Russian state actors.

Of course you link the Miami Herald, a paper that has repeatedly been shown to lie about Desantis.  Now do New York and a host of Democrat run states which has the same issue with investments in russia.  Oh that's different though huh?  What did russia specifically do when New York tried to sell its $300M in russian stock?  Ohh pushaw pushaw, russia blocked those sales in early March so they couldn't divest.  Ooops.  Besides, rushing to sell would violate the oath the trustees in control of the funds took, as the decision to sell right now isn't in the best interests of the funds, but who cares about oaths and the law right?  It's nothing but a virtue signaling move that directly hurts the funds and those they benefit.  As much as you'd like to think it is, reality isn't simple."

And she had more culpability than almost any American in creating the current situation. She wrote the ""Chicken Kiev"" speech for Bush, imploring the Ukrainians not to declare independence from the Soviet Union. She had more responsibility for anyone of shaping the post-Soviet US policy of then looking the other way while Russia violated the sovereignty of countries they considered 'theirs'. Intervening in Georgia, Moldova, Tajikistan, Nagorno-Karabakh, etc.

There was never any 'deal' that NATO would not expand into ex-Soviet countries, there was never any 'deal' that Russia's 'sphere of influence' should be respected.

However, what if they installed speakers on those drones that would play a certain sound after the bomb had been dropped, such as screaming voices from hell or something similar? 

After a while everyone would associate this sound with bombs being dropped from invisible drones.

Then you could also send drones that just play this sound and everybody on the ground has to seek shelter because there could be a bomb... But you they never know. I imagine this could add quite a bit of psychological stress and impact, cost some sleep, nerves, and disrupt whatever they're doing."

>making sure that no US government aid was put in there is prudent.

Basically as soon Moldova became independent and wanted to put Romanian as the first language of the country,there was a big stir up of the Russian speaking part of Transnistria. Fearing Moldova would voluntairely be annexed by Romania. So Russia stirred up the conflict even more a revolution broke out  and send peacetroops to settle the argument. What they actually did was make it like a frozen conflict as Moldova hardly had an army and couldnt oppose Ruzzia. So the whole Donbass and Luhansk republics,itsabout the same as what Transnistria is. Ruzzia even installed a general as the local dictator and made Transistria solely depended on itself economicly.  
One year later Ruzzia tried the same thing in Estonia with Narva,but Etonian politics was a little smarter in handling it. Ruzzian troops were also on Estonian soil. And they actally organized a referendum for it to break away: https://voxeurop.eu/en/the-little-russia-that-wanted-to-break-away/  
Then we have Belarus. Belarus began as one of the most promising former Sovjet states when it came to democracy and values. But had an election with Lukashenko who used his status as anti corruption clerk to gain trust with local people. Soon and slowly LUkahsenko was stripping Belarus from its values and freedom. He couldnt have done it with the support of Ruzzia whome was the most important economic engine for the Belarus economy.So what Ruzzia basically did was make them economicly almost completely dependent of them. So Lukhsenko has to dance the dance Putin wants him to.  
Then we have Hungary. Hungary is a bit special. Basically in the nineties Hungary got overrun by the Russian mafia in their own city: Budapest. The Russians became the big player, the FSB has always used crimegroups as foreign agents aswell, so for them it was an extention to operate in Hungary. Ive read one crimebook about the mafia in Europe in which a story comes to play where a source claims that Orban was already an asset of the FSB in the early nineties.

1. If the Russians can't hold the Dnipro, then they can't hold anything.
2. Every Russian move from here on is going to look disastrous, because every move will be designed to avoid an even bigger disaster.

Russia held on to right-bank Kherson as long as they could, because losing that ground puts Ukrainian artillery (HIMARS) within range of the Crimean bottleneck and the transport routes through Melitopol. Without these LOCs it is impossible to hold left-bank Kherson.

Left-bank Kherson is critical because of Ukrainian successes in targeting warships, and Russian failure in gaining air superiority. Without protection from Kherson, Crimea cannot reliably be resupplied by air or sea. The only remaining supply route for Crimea will be the Kerch Bridge, and Ukraine will be much closer going through the Sea of Azov than the Black Sea. To defend the Sea of Azov, Russia would have to use the Black Sea Fleet.

Regardless, Ukraine will eventually be able to attack the Kerch Bridge from left-bank Kherson. If the bridge is destroyed, then this begins a chain of strategic catastrophes for Russia. Ships in the Black Sea Fleet will be trapped by the destroyed bridge, either in the Black Sea or the Sea of Azov. If in the Sea of Azov, then I think Ukraine picks at them until they hide in Rostov-on-Don. If in the Black Sea then they can contribute to the defence of Crimea, but it's worse in the long run.

With Kherson under Ukrainian control, both seas contested, and the Kerch Bridge destroyed, defending Crimea becomes impossible. It also becomes difficult to extract troops and equipment from Crimea, preventing their use in the east (if that is still ongoing).

Whoever controls Crimea, controls the Black Sea. The threat of Neptune missiles from Crimea would force the remnants of the Black Sea Fleet to hide, either near Istanbul or near Georgia, with no hope of resupply. If Ukraine manages to develop an air-launched Neptune, or is given the air-launched Harpoon or similar, then the Black Sea Fleet will be forced out of the Black Sea, or destroyed. If Russia refuses to negotiate after Ukraine retakes all territory, then this is one of the levers NATO can use to force peace in Ukraine's favour.

I honestly don't think that Putin can survive the loss of Crimea and the Donbas region. Throw in some more irreplaceable warships at the bottom of the Black Sea, and another 20-30,000 dead Russians, and there's no way that he hangs on."

I didnt know that and now Ive got some reading to do. Thanks! I still believe Russia is on a weakening trajectory as far as military forces, instead of a strengthening one like the Nazis in the late 30s.

I have to disagree on a few major points regarding the nukes. 

Its a lot more reasonable to be gun-shy, as you say, when they are involved. 

Your claim that Putin isnt deterred by them doesnt really hold water. He seems very careful when dealing directly with NATO and other nuclear powers. For just a few examples, he showed restraint when Turkey shot down a Russian military plane. He didnt do anything rash against NATO when the USA hit his ally Syria with cruise missiles, or assisted the Ukrainian people in overthrowing their Russian puppet government. Hes a thug when he gets the chance, but hes still very careful around nuclear enemies, the same way NATO is.

I also doubt this idea that Russia somehow doesnt have nuclear weapons anymore. Its a very popular idea right now and the evidence boils down to two things:

Nuclear deterrence limits some of the ways we could kick Putin, so it would be better if it didnt exist.

And

Russia made the mistake of invading a mid-sized country that had been fortifying since their last war and had tons of foreign weapons, while not really upgrading Russian forces beyond peacetime levels. Russia is losing the current battles in that country. That means every part of their military must be totally ineffective.

I dont find that evidence convincing."

The guy is charged with crimes against humanity so he is not a good guy in any way. The ""revolution"" is very shady, there was probably some resistance from Ceausescu's gang, NOT ONLY FAKE RESISTANCE organized by Iliescu himself (which is the ONLY clear thing that actually happened), but it is not clear what was actually going on there. The most generous interpretation is that the army guy didn't want to kill people on the streets so he decided to give the power to Iliescu, but there were some other shady incidents that indicate maybe it was planned for some time as some people in the security services saw the writing on the wall and decided to get rid of him.

There were some jokes but Romanians generally were thoroughly brainwashed. I've never met an old person that striked me as some kind of underground anti-communist resistance, they were very enthusiastic about the whole system, if they just gave them more food it's possible the regime would still be going strong, actually after Iliescu took power nothing really changed (actually he wanted to continue the ""communist"" thing but caved in due to popular demand) and it took like a decade for Romanians to learn what not being a stupid commie is all about, and some of them will never learn."

Inflation has nothing or very little to do with with the reduction of business ""risk"" as you call it. 

We all seem that have short term memories. But If I recall, the previous administration was going all out to ensure all of our trade partners ""paid their fair share"". Meaning closing the trade deficit with China, and re-working the NAFTA agreement. 

This was done again in a very blunt matter. The imports from China were imposed a 26% tax. Across the board, with specific and coincidentally exemptions for Trump daughter line of fashion items made overseas (pure coincidence of course). 

Problem is, The Chinese government controls their central bank. Meaning they can (and have) re-adjusted their currency value as they see fit. Something the US Gov can not do. 

So when the US imposed a 26% tax, the Chinese re-adjusted their currency down by \~26% to off-set the tax. And the cherry on top of the shit-cake was that none (not a single one) supply contracts for goods imported are signed using the Chinese Yuan. They are all signed using the US Dollar.  Does not take a math genius to see what the results are. 

This meant that 100% of the tax cost would be passed on to the US consumers. So a automatic 26% increase in 99.9% of all goods sold at your favorite Walmart. Instantly.   

What delayed this impact on the COGS, was the pandemic. That instantly froze trade. Meaning the full impact of the 26% was delayed by 2 years. Until all the sudden, we are passed the last wave. And roaring to get back into it. And guess what! That 26% tax is still roaring as well. 

US Business hate $hit during COVID by dealing with lower demand for goods. But now its ""Time to pay up bitches"". 

And then we have the tax we imposed (and removed, and re-imposed, and modified, and re-imposed) on Aluminum & steel coming from Canada. That did quite a number on the beverage industry (aluminum Cans). One of the cheapest beverage packaging cost when up by 15% instantly. 

BTW, all Trump had to do, was lift these TAXES (tariffs). Even if it was just an interim action, say 12 months. But I don't think he could think that far. 

And for trade deficit. The correct action is to mandate an increasing and gradual minimum US made or assembled content for all good sold within this country. Meaning, Per example: APPLE would need to have a minimum of 10% of its parts or assembly labor made here (right now, nothing from APPLE is made in the US, amazing for a US company). And you increase that amount annually over time until you balance the trade deficit. It gives time for business to adjust, and creates jobs. I don't think the 26% tax created any jobs, but it is hitting tax payers wallets."

In fact, often for both for missiles and nukes you want to detonate above ground. This increases the radius of destruction. For nukes specifically you want to create the Mach stem. A nuclear warhead is made by ""wrapping"" a nuke core in conventional explosives. It is of course much more complex then that but in essence, the conventional explosives along with a burst of neutrons from a neutron source create conditions needed for starting a massive fission reaction. Again, don\`t get me wrong. Even though it sounds simple, nukes are incredibly hard to produce and maintain due to tolerances that are needed. However, once you make one, it is simply the matter of detonating the conventional explosives around the core. It becomes just as simple as detonating a conventional warhead. That said, there are (i hope) many more safety features that prevent detonation in a nuke compared to a conventional warhead. The problem for me is that we are dealing with Russians here. We know that their nuclear arsenal is in terrible shape. We know that there are several factions within the Russian horde etc. That can present a problem."

That's ridiculous.

I don't remember knowing many persons ""enthusiastic about the whole system"", maybe a couple ""enthusiastic"" about the power they thought they had. 

People knew the system is broken. Some people hoped it can be repaired, and made better from the inside (they got fewer and fewer in the 70s and 80s) some waited for the opportunity or hoped Ceausescu will die.

But people talked, about what they could do, what they should do.

Before the great WOII, the Poles had shaped their country and  it mainly consisted of the current eastern Poland combined with parts of the current Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine. So at the aftermath of WOII, Germany lost terriroty. Mainly Stalin demanded eastern Parts of Germany for Poland and at the same time other parts where Poland had presence \[eastern part of Poland\] were appointed to other countries. One can jokingly say that Poland was a country on wheels and it was pulled more to the West. As a conclusion the Poles were thrown out of some parts the current Ukraine and Belarus and they were appointed the lands of eastern Germany and kicked out the Germans. Places like Danzig became Gdansk for example.  
The side effect of this all was that the Poland became a very pure ethnic country because only Poles were living in the new country.Until this day it ranks on the top of the world  of most dominant ethnic ethnicity in one country. If I am not mistaken Bolivia is also one up there. Thus in this huge land were only Poles are living there wasnt the room for Russia to stir up Russian sentiment of Russian minorities still living there. 

  
Other reasons also stem from history, Poland has always had bad relations with Russia.Lets first get to the sneaky way Russia and Germany signed a truce and in the sidelines made a pact to devide Poland. This whole sentiment hits home hard with the Polish now because they see the same trickery happening in Ukraine now. Russia early this year on the borders with Ukraine claiming it wouldnt attack and were just doing some training, and Russia trying to takeover Ukraine and erase Ukrainian culture in the process.  
 In WOII there were a few incidents like the Katyn massacre, a place were the Sovjets excecuted more than twenty thousand Polish military men. Also when the Polish were fighting of the Germans, Stalin ordered his army to wait and not help the Poles.He was watching in a distance how his one enemy Germany was fighting against his other future enemy Polish nationalists whome he deemed a potential future threat.The Poles saw  this as the ultimate treason.

If you go back longer in history you will find even more reasons why the Poles dislike Russia.   


Lastly there is the whole security issue. The Polish don't want Russia at their border, they see the whole risk. Poland has been integrating much better in the EU and bisunesses are interlinked with the EU. This has brought a growing economy and relative wealth. The Poles no damn well what happen with their economy or culture once their Russian friends return. Hungary for the other part is much more dependend on Russia for their economy."

She was also listed the first time as a horse rider in a tournament the same year the GmbH was founded: https://archiv.turnierauskunft.de/veranstaltung/361231006/statistik_a_reiter.php

The address that was formerly registered as the company's address is a fake address of another Reiterhof: https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ostenholzer+Str.+8,+29308+Winsen+(Aller)/@52.7319271,9.846071,321m

Also, I'd argue that it was a fake address with which she registered the company because usually there's a liquidator in place once a company goes broke (who handles potential debts for the next 5 years after the liquidation). But because there's no legal liquidator and there was not a lawyer registered either as the new owner of the company it's usually a hint that the Amtsgericht realized that the address was fake when it was registered. That takes two years because there's a latency of the legal process once the required Handelsregister report for the first financial year hasn't been published (+ 6 months time to hand in the report later, + 6 months for legal process).

According to SPIEGEL information, planning errors in the ordering of spare parts are increasingly jeopardizing the operational readiness of German self-propelled howitzers in Ukraine. Following the delivery of a total of 14 self-propelled howitzers 2000, the German Ministry of Defense had failed to order extensive spare parts packages in time to regularly maintain the weapon systems and thus keep them operational.

In the meantime, a large part of the artillery systems supplied by Germany is in need of repair due to intensive use on the front in eastern Ukraine. According to Bundeswehr sources, the Ukrainians are currently firing around 300 shells a day, which is severely wearing down the weapon systems.

Six German howitzers were recently brought to Lithuania for technical overhaul. However, since the necessary spare parts for the howitzers were not available either from the industry or from the Bundeswehr, the technicians had to cannibalize one of the howitzers and leave it in Lithuania for the time being.

The lack of spare parts does not come as a surprise. In late summer, the Bundeswehr's procurement office had already unsuccessfully urged the ministry to order extensive spare parts packages for the howitzers and the Mars II multiple rocket launchers, since the special material had long delivery times. So far, however, no corresponding instruction has come from the so-called Special Staff Ukraine.

The lack of spare parts is now also paralyzing the so-called repair hub that Germany plans to set up in Slovakia by mid-December to repair weapons delivered there."

 My point is - this ""lets understand our enemy"" mind exercises are fairly useless. Yes - to a point it is useful to predict how our enemies will react in certain situations - but when it devolves to ""Russians are humans too. They are not smarter or dumber than you and I."" type of thinking - then we crossed from trying to win a war to trying to figure out who we should be more sorry for. And that's nonsense only philosophers and psychiatrists have time for.

 All we need to know here is - how long will the Russian people continue obediently sending their kids to the slaughter? If - like for the Germans in WW2 - the answer is ""Until total defeat"" - then Milley is right and we probably need to get  some sort of peace deal in place, possibly without Ukraine getting back Crimea - as the alternative is a decade+ of war and the West would have to fund it the entire way as Ukraine is unable to. If - on the other hand - Russian society is about to break - then helping Ukraine with weapons is the way to go.

 In reality - the answer is probably somewhere in between and while Russians might tolerate more mobilization now - their situation is getting worse and worse as they lose military equipment and their economy suffers. Where is the point of no return for them? WW1 style defeat with millions dead and a large chunk of Russia under occupation?

The US government owes money to itself when it runs a deficit. Again, sans 10 years in the ENTIRE HISTORY of the country - we have ran a deficit.

But to address the national debt...

The super majority of the national debt is held within US borders by US companies who have an incentive to keep the economy going.

And for the rest of the world buying our dollars...

They will keep buying them because the US is the leading economy coupled with the fact that the most sought after resource, oil, is traded in greenbacks.

And countries keep the greenback valuation high by Petro washing their oil sales. This is why the US government pushed OPEC so hard to trade in greenbacks so soon after the Bretton Woods agreement where we ceases to use the gold standard. 

Now, I'll admit that if oil ceases to be traded in greenbacks then the US is probably fucked. But our military industrial complex works well to see that not come to fruition.

It's also probably why neither democrat nor republican is really **that** keen on seeing green energy replace oil. Not unless we can figure out a way for electricity to be traded in greenbacks, internationally."

Furthermore, it just plays into Russian propaganda, which has tried to lower support for aid by pushing lies about Ukraine misappropriating funds and selling equipment. Calling for such lies to be taken seriously is not good governance."

The longer range missiles cost about 6x more ($1,000,000 per missile) than the ones they use now; on top of that, only one of the long range missiles can fit in the HIMARS system compared to the six with the current missiles. The longer range is also not as big of an advantage as it seems, since it gives more time for Russian air defenses to kick in, and you are more likely to be wasting more expensive weapons. So you can either throw six missiles at closer targets that you are more likely to hit and have a potentially major impact on the battlefield, or throw one missile at a target that is less likely to hit and be a much bigger waste of resources."

How is pretty simple, they crossed the borders in the east and north (from Belarus). If you want to go back a bit further to 2014, Russian assets colluded with separatists in Crimea and the eastern part of the country. They organized and provided arms. Russian soldiers on ""vacation"" in Ukraine joined in the fight. They mounted a rebellion, then held a flawed referendum to become independent. 

The why is more complicated and we will never know exactly what was going on in Putin's head. There are several factors that probably went into his decision though. Ukraine was becoming more Western, and he was losing his influence in the country. He had tried putting in a puppet government, but that didnt work. Large natural resource deposits, including oil and natural gas, were discovered in the eastern part of the country and in the waters surrounding Crimea. There was talk of Western companies helping Ukraine develop these resources. These would be in direct competition to the resources Russia sold to the West, and to add insult to injury, they would use the same Soviet pipelines that Russia had been paying Ukraine to use. This may have been what led to the 2014 invasion. As a response to the 2014 invasion, Ukraine cut off the water supply to Crimea by building a dam. Russia had to then truck in water, which was extremely expensive. It also reduced the agricultural and industrial uses of the land in Crimea, which was creating some minor discontent with the citizenry.

 >The Holodomor (Ukrainian: , romanized: Holodomor, IPA: [olodomr]; derived from  , moryty holodom, 'to kill by starvation'), also known as the Terror-Famine or the Great Famine, was a man-made famine in Soviet Ukraine from 1932 to 1933 that killed millions of Ukrainians. The Holodomor was part of the wider Soviet famine of 19321933 which affected the major grain-producing areas of the country. While scholars universally agree that the cause of the famine was man-made, whether the Holodomor constitutes a genocide remains in dispute.

Has Putin gotten so weak that Prigozhin sees his chance at possibly taking control through controlling the remnants of the military fighting in Ukraine? Putin may just see it as easier to let him keep saying the things he is to take attention and heat off himself, but I cant help but think that Prigozhin smells the last throes of a dying dictator, Putin. Wagner is the only part of the operation that still has more positive views from mil-bloggers and pro-war parties back home and he seems to be living that up, while also making Putins time with the MoD that much harder and obvious.

Maybe Im wrong? He goes from never admitting anything about owning Wagner to admitting everything and giving speeches and publicly calling out the MoD and just kind of doing whatever he wants bc he knows he cant be stopped now. Kadyrov talks a lot too, but thats just what he does. But if he decides to stick with Wagner over the MoD too, is there too much more they need Putin for? With the country in shambles?

The accuracy isnt going to be as good as other indirect fire systems. The rocket payload is just okay when used in that manner. 

But like the Mi-17 is still awesome for casevac, challenging resupply missions, and its definitely Ukraines best air assault platform. I understand in a contested air space its not as easy to use them in a traditional CAS or air assault function. But with Russia on the other side of Dnipier and in Crimea there may come a time in the not so distant future when Ukraine needs air assault capabilities and needs the ability to absorb a not insignificant amount of air frame losses.

no.

>And which of those ""count"" as credible threats to Ukraine

pretty much anything with guns and missiles on it is gonna count as a credible threat. that includes the kilo-class subs since they're able to lob cruisemissiles from the torpedo tubes.

&#x200B;

>how many are actively at work in this war?

pretty much all of it in various roles. the landing class ships are handling supplies and logistics. they dock at kerch port to supply crimea. others make trips up to berdyansk and mariupol too. 

&#x200B;

the krivaks can function as short range air defense, since they've got 2 OSA sam systems in VLS tubes. they're pretty capable anti-submarine warfare ships as per their function. 

&#x200B;

the tarantul class corvettes are nasty little missileboats that can lob various cruise missiles and anti ship missiles from 4 horizontally placed missile tubes. they're in pairs of 2 on either side of the helm. 

&#x200B;

the buyan-M class has 2x4 VLS tubes that are capable of lobing onix and kalibr cruise missiles.

Remember, Russia turned off the pipeline, so their competitors actually had no benefit to blowing up an unusable pipeline. Maybe it would be turned back on later, but that isn't a certainty. Couple that with very steep and dramatic costs if they got caught. So, unclear benefits, almost certainly high costs. As such, if the US did blow them up, they shouldn't have, as doing so harmed their over-all interests.   

Meanwhile, Russia faces no real costs: they have plenty of other pipelines running to Europe that they could sell gas through, yet still refuse to do so. On the other hand, while the benefits didn't pay off, dividing Europe over supporting Ukraine would win them the war, which is all they care about. Immense benefits, very little cost, if Russia did not blow up the pipelines, they should have.

Just think about it - people are buying bullshit about EU government trying to cripple or kill them with vaccines, or masks being restriction on their freedom! 40 years ago anyone saying stuff like that would be considered insane nutjob by everyone around them.

Back in March/April when John Kirby was still the Spox for the Pentagon, he remarked about how the Pentagon specifically setup a ""deconfliction line"" that allowed lower level staff outside of the political leadership to communicate about non-political issues or more importantly issues that require immediate attention such as this.

During this time period reporters would ask him about it and he'd indicate that the US would ring up Russia every month or so just to make sure the line was working. Literally all they needed was a ""Yup, still working"" but it was clear from the DoD Spox's responses that Russia didn't answer most of the time, though it was clearly working because it would indeed ring and when the Russians did pick up they wouldn't complain about anything wrong.

Ok so, there is that.

But I tend to combine this with other evidence that Ukraine hadn't modified their S-300's for ground to ground, only Russia had. And further, that all Ukrainian S-300's were expressly programmed to blow up in mid air if they missed their target. 

Together that is still not conclusive, but it does cast at least some doubt that the S-300's in Poland were Ukrainian. And that's as far as I can go. Investigations are needed before this is written off as a Ukrainian mistake. And Zelensky is being pretty adamant that they are NOT Ukrainian.

&#x200B;

i'm not gonna state you're either right or wrong. this event might be an absolute tragedy in the case a ukrainian air defense missile malfunctioned, or an action with hostile intent if russia knowingly fired a missile as the agressor which they knew might malfunction.

&#x200B;

i will leave you with this.

&#x200B;

52.018561, 23.794991

&#x200B;

this is a large military base in Brest, Belarus. russians have been using bases across belarus for their invasion. first for their invasion towards kyiv and chernihiv. when that failed, they used airfields to launch jets from. they have launched shahed drones and cruise missiles from belarus throughout this war. belarus is a russian ally, and russia has full military acces to belarus. this is simple fact. you're aware of this. 

&#x200B;

4955'19.0""N 2343'08.9""E

&#x200B;

this is a depot in ivano-frankove (not ivano-frankivske, that's further to the south, south east, this one is just west of lviv) if you go into streetview, you can see this depot has the emblem of the ukrainian military on it's wall. ukraine stores vehicles here. no doubt about it.

&#x200B;

if you were to draw a line, between that base in brest, belarus. and the depot in ivano frankovske. guess where that line passes over.infact, just go ahead and use the distance measuring tool in google maps to draw a line between those coordinates.

&#x200B;

now, we also know that russia uses S-300 missiles that they've modified to strike ground targets. essentially turning the S-300 missile into a ballistic missile. it's not easy to do so. not everyone that has the S-300 system has the know-how to do that. but russia has a dedicated team of 20 people that reprogram these missiles in order to strike ground targets. 

&#x200B;

[https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2022/10/24/the-remote-control-killers-behind-russias-cruise-missile-strikes-on-ukraine/](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2022/10/24/the-remote-control-killers-behind-russias-cruise-missile-strikes-on-ukraine/)

&#x200B;

that reprogramming isn't something simple apperently. and there's a small group of russian military personel that handles the input of coordinates for those missiles.

&#x200B;

take a look at the coordinates for kyiv. you'll find kyiv is on the same easting as the town in poland that was struck. take a look at the coordinates for lviv. you'll find lviv is on the same northing as the polish town was struck. simply put, if you take the northing from lviv, and the easting from kyiv. you end up with a coordinate that brings you near the town in poland that was hit. who'se to say those goons didn't get their coordinates mixed up?

&#x200B;

so next, concider how the USA and NATO might view an adequate response to either scenario. russia lobs a missile at ukraine that lands in poland. or ukraine lobs a missile in self defence that tragically malfunctions and lands in poland. what's the easier scenario to sell without resorting to conflict?

  
in the case of russia lobbing a missile with hostile intent that misses its target and lands in poland, assurances and guarantees have to be put in place to prevent that scenario from happening again. ergo, on the high end of the response spectrum there's a no fly zone option. anything over ukraine, belarus or russia that comes towards nato and is considered hostile is shot out of the sky. either by AA, jets or any other option. at the middle end of that spectrum is establishing an air defense shield on the polish border that reaches out over the border, into belarus and ukraine, and shoots down anything that's considered hostile. on the low end of that spectrum is establishing an air defense shield along the polish border that shoots down anything that actually crosses into polish territory. that's a huge fucking thing no matter what solution you provide to give those assurances and guarantees. but those assurances and guarantees must be provided in such a scenario to qualify as an adequate response. 

&#x200B;

in the scenario where ukraine fires an air defense missile in self defense that tragically malfunctions, the likely response that's seen as adequate is covering the incident with a blanket of understanding, and ensuring ukraine doesn't have to rely on shitty faulty malfunctioning russian made air defense systems in the future, so that another incident like this will be prevented that way.

&#x200B;

i'm not gonna tell you what's right or wrong, i don't have acces to all the information surrounding this event. neither do you. and i'd be surprised if nato or the USA itself actually has radar tracks that confirm beyond a shadow of a doubt where the missile originated from. and even if they do, it could still very well be a ukrainian s-300 missile that intercepted a russian cruise missile in just the right way where the s-300 exploded near enough to a russian cruise missile to knock it out of the sky but the warhead still detonated on impact. 

&#x200B;

we just don't know. and wether we'll ever know is in the hands of the parties investigating the incident and the evidence they supply. what i will tell you, is without final conclusions of the investigation, it's too early for people like you and i to draw conclusions yet.

&#x200B;

personally, i've got faith in ukraine, ukraines leadership and command structure. i'm inclinded to believe zelensky if he says his air force and zaluzhny himself reported that it was not an ukrainian missile. though, it should be noted that zelensky also stated to accept the outcome of the investigation and if it does turn out to have been an ukrainian missile, ukraine will formally appologise to poland and pay reperations for the damage done."

Multiple months have already passed now. Progress on MBTs? 0%.

If Ukraine stopped, Russia would destroy them and take everything they have. Who are the Imperialists here? Pretty obvious, no? Sometimes you need to fight for what is right. Like fighting the cartels. Or is it better to live under someone that can just go ahead and cut your head off because they feel like it? Maybe some history that you should study is the history of the USSR's and Russia's global manipulation campaigns which were a massive part of the subterfuge that they employed to try and weaken the rest of the world and to promote the Russian agenda. Maybe that will help. But please, don't sit here and spread misinformation and tell people to look at it from the ""other point of view"" when it is objectively wrong and even borderline evil.

It takes a lot of additional infrastructure, material, produ tion space, component inventory, workers, etc., to spool up production. Most of all it takes time and money. Money Congress has to apportion: This takes time.

Ramping production from the 10's per month to the hundreds/thousands needed, if the funding and logistics is in place, will take anywhere from 6 months to two years!

1) How much can Ukraine trust Russia to keep its word for any territory lost? They had an agreement with Russia in the 90s, that didnt keep Russia out. The only way the agreement would have strength is if Ukraine then joined NATO or the EU, which Russia said they would not accept.

2) Whats Russia going to do if they dont like the terms, threaten to invade more?

3) Ukraine has momentum and strong support from the west, Russia is doing poorly and only has middling support from a few nations, including mixed signals from China. Ukraine looks able withstand war for longer at this point and is gaining territory back. Russia is the opposite.

4) Modern nations have tried to dispel the notion of wars of territorial expansion. Allowing Russia to do this would embolden other countries to try it."

I'm not familiar with any, though I don't claim encyclopedic knowledge on the subject. Care to provide an example?

>and what kind of ""education"" was encouraged anyway?

Intellectual enlightenment was considered a path to godliness in those times, which is why it was a codified part of a monk's living. Part of why monasteries became de facto copy-houses and churches founded and maintained many of the world's libraries in the first millennium AD was due to monks copying out reference texts for use in their studies and contemplations (pre-Christian texts and works of knowledge from antiquity were considered invaluable to contextualize religious scripture). That gave them levels of literacy and skills in book production that were rare in the Middle Ages (book production being a much, much more labour-intensive task in the age before the printing press) and their scope of preservation gradually broadened.

>if scientific progress was widely propagated anywhere in the middle ages,it definitely wasnt in the sphere of influence of the book burning,script hoarding catholic church 

Kind of odd that your emoji-laden screed is zeroing in on the catholic church when I was referencing a much wider body of institutions than just them, but you do you.

>you do not propagate science by picking and choosing what results you like and tucking everything else away

Which the church generally didn't do. Think about what you're saying - in that era, due to the fact that there was no such thing as ""atmospheric controls"" or proper seals on houses, moisture damage, mold, and other environmental conditions quickly degraded books and other texts, necessitating that they had to be constantly re-copied. You're saying that the church, rather than either destroying these works or just letting nature run its course, decided instead to seal them away yet bizarrely still go through the rather arduous process of maintaining them? That makes zero sense.

Also, if we're being technical, yes, you do propagate science that way. For one, results that are considered erroneous or poorly founded get discarded all the time - that's a normal part of the scientific method. For two, even discounting that, science is still being propagated the way you've phrased it - just not in its entirety.

>to this day paywalls and elitist for profit capture hinder true scientific progress,and that was many times worse back then

I don't disagree, but I also don't think it furthers your point. Education was the domain of the rich and privileged for most of human history, largely because for most of human history we didn't have the tools needed to conduct mass education (hard to educate an entire populace when 90+% of them are needed for food production and distribution, and where a single copy of a book takes months if not years of multiple peoples' work to produce). 

Some historical perspective is in order to contextualize this viewpoint."

As always there is more than one viewpoint. Russia deserves the condemnation for invading, but let's not pretend the US is innocent in all this. They gave verbal assurances which while not a formal treaty, still means something and it helped bring about a mostly peaceful end to the cold war. 

Instead of helping integrate post communist Russia, they hung them out to dry and expanded NATO eastwards at every opportunity. Using this ""strictly defensive alliance"" to take offensive actions in the Balkan war. And then we wonder why Russia is on constantly on edge.

She is opposed to the DDL Zan, an anti-homophobia law that would expand the Mancino law to cover LGBT discrimination, declaring in 2020 that ""there is no homophobia"" in Italy. She is also opposed to surrogacy, which is pejoratively known in Italian as utero in affitto, and she has pushed in Parliament for a law to make it a ""universal crime"". Meloni is supportive of the anti-gender movement, based on Catholic theology in the 1990s that condemns social positions not approved by the Catholic Church, including gender studies, and she is sceptical of what she calls ""gender ideology"";she says it is being taught in schools and that it attacks female identity and motherhood. She is supportive of changing the Constitution of Italy in order to make it illegal for same-sex couples to adopt children.

The Soviets expected the battlefield to be alternately nuclear contaminated or not, and their IFVs allowed fighting whether enclosed or dismounted. The Germans focused on anti-air accompaniment for tanks, as the tank's biggest enemy is aircraft. Only if the battlefield is uncontaminated would you be worried about infantry rushing your tanks, at which point German IFVs would dismount as well. The Americans took care of enemy aircraft with aircraft of their own, meaning APCs would be sufficient to accompany tanks, disembarking only if enemy troops tried to rush.

They didn't have to.  We could have all been friendly nations to eachother.  But that's the route they took.  We could have cared less about Russia and just went about our lives only to find out that they have been super creepily hyperfocused on us talking smack for 20 years all to rile up their nationalism and unite them in this Russia vs the wEsT bs.  I never heard the wEsT so much in my entire life the way I have in past 9 months. the wEsT is part of almost all of the Kremlins talk and daily Russian TV talk.  Lol its really pathetic and creepy.

Reality is that the war has multiple components: economic, military, moral among them.

They will not run out of russian military that is willing to die.

Finally, at some point ugly facts related to the war will surface up: shitty treatment of the soldiers, corruption, theft, increasing percentage of russians who reject the war will make a dent.

russia fires missiles dileberatly to harm ukraine. which then forces ukraine to defend itself quite literally by all means possible. if the missile was fired by russia, then russia is the one that initiated the action, russia is the one that opted for a flight path that directed the missile over poland. russia is the one to blame for intruding on sovereign soil."

Despite all the talk about how Ukraine will decide the terms of negotiations, the US is putting heavy pressure on Ukraine to back off from their all-of-Ukraine-back position. It looks like Biden will accept a temporary win, even if it means it's just a pause for Russia to recoup and recover. I guess he doesn't have the stomach to go for Putin's jugular. Either that or he's hoping for a ""win"" before the next elections.

I also disagree with Milley's assessment - I believe a full victory is possible, especially if NATO gives Ukraine what it needs. But even without it, RU forces are in disarray. Not saying it will be a walk in the park, but we're not talking about a year-long stalemate at the front."

Reagan's irrationality, unpredictability, and strong man stance helped bring down the USSR that brought greater freedom to hundreds of millions behind the iron curtain.  By no means do I believe Trump was playing 4D chess, but I think he understands that showing strength is a major deterrent to misbehavior by others. A strong-man type willing use military force to achieve goals or at least punish misbehavior can prevent a lot of other bad actors from doing the same.  

Under Trump, there was no escalation of the Ukraine war by Russia despite media peddling how he was in Putins pocket.  Trump ordered the bombing of a Russian occupied airbase in Syria in retaliation for crossing an Obama red line, killed the main Iranian General responsible for organizing many terrorist attacks in Iraq, and is one of the few U.S. presidents to have allowed U.S. forces to directly fire on and kill hundreds of Russian mercenaries.  The russian ""little green men"" that took over Crimea without insignia certainly weren't so bold after the U.S. killed hundreds of them in Syria.  There are good reasons and precedent to believe that Trumps eagerness to appear strong prevented the escalation of the Ukrainian conflict during his presidency.

As Americans, we like to think others think like us and if we're just reasonable and play nice, so will others.  But that is not the case, and many leaders around the world would order horrific acts if they did not fear retaliation.  An irrational strong man is not always a bad thing as long as there are proper guardrails.

I obviously do not know all the details or can connect all the dots to know specifically how history would have changed, but Clinton, Bush, and Obama all helped lead to this war by isolating Russia, exiting treaties and attempting to build anti-ballistic missile defense right on the Russian border, while at the same time continuously trying to expand NATO, long after the USSR was done.  I don't know if that was pushed by old school CIA because they still perceived a threat, but from my laymen view it seemed unnecessary.   There was no way Russia would accept NATO countries with anti-ballistic missiles right up on their border where they are most effective.  Trying to eliminate the local influence of a former super power while all the people from its superpower days are still around is not necessarily a rational, adult decision either.  Ukraine could have waited a decade to join NATO after the old Soviet guard passed, and a conflict of this scale may have been avoided."

2. Probably. That is their standard procedure. That and fight proxy wars.

3 key here is China. What will they do in the vacuum and how does that play out in 10,20 years. Is it real close ties or its slow takeover of resources in the region?

4 it will in nato influenced areas. But not in countries that dont fight traditional wars like Afghanistan it doesnt work. This was have been a full attrition battle.

I dont disagree with any of this. Where they managed to fight back to we will see. But at some point the majority of fighting will end and lines drawn.

It can hang out in safe areas and is basically a truck with gantry. The missile pods are manufactured elsewhere. Simply installed, then removed and replaced when empty. The most complex part is the training of its firing system.

A tank is an utterly different beast. So much more is required of its functionality at the front lines. It's going to see a lot more wear and tear than a truck driving in safer areas that will unlikely ever even receive gunfire while on mission. Russia has yet to destroy a single HIMARS. Tanks drive over *everything* their treads and grip. They fire dozens of rounds per mission which means having to load all that ammo every time. The gun itself will be care for that. They will receive fire of all levels from gunfire, RPG, and artillery. They require a fully trained crew that takes longer than HIMARS would. The tank treads getting clogged with everything they have to drive through because you don't get tidy roads on the front line. Not to mention its engine or the massive amounts of fuel necessary for the beast.

I'm not saying it couldn't be done but it's just not as anywhere near as simple as HIMARS. Like the other comment said logistics is a huge deal and a tank is going to need a lot more love, which is why Russia's awful logistics loses them so many of theirs. 

I want Ukraine to have everything the US can give them and more. I still try to wrap my head around why NATO doesn't just roll in, and no I'm not clueless as to why not but my heart aches knowing Ukrainians die because the world that's helping them is so ""hands off."" Again, I know the reasons but it sucks anyway.

Car travel is a different concept than high speed trains.  
It is literally about constantly connecting two cities, as if it is one.

It not abot travel, as in ""journey""  
Its about ""commuting"".  


Its Competative to air planes by speed, just without the hassle checking in at the airports, which are mostly not in the center of a city but in its outskirts.

Also US has not a good railway system for public transportation.

Instead you have traditional grayhound bus network.

Considering Russia is a major fossil fuel exporter that solves the ""cheap energy"" part. And the fact that they control a giant landmass with fuck tons of natural resources would solve the ""capital"" part. Whatever natural resource they can't make they could buy.

Every other issue is their own fault. Even the concept of being out competed by another country in a certain industry doesn't hold water since any country that cares about a certain industry enough will take measures to keep it afloat. Like the United states right now trying to start up a semi conductor industry at home out of fear that Taiwan will be invaded by china therefore putting their semi conductor industry into the hands of the CCP. Russia is an example of being your own worst enemy.

Large countries with vast amounts of natural resources and the ability to feed hundreds of millions don't really have an excuse for being so pathetic. Look at all the other players on the world stage that share those features. You have India, the us, china, and maybe Brazil. And except for Brazil they are all either global powers or rising regional powers. Russia is a declining regional power. And India has to deal with the fact that all of its neighbors are imploding (Pakistan, sri lanka ). Meanwhile Russia is bordered by Europe, a non hostile continent that would more than willingly establish very lucrative trade with Russia."

Estonia and Latvia are NATO countries and they are on Russia's doorstep and a lot closer to St. Petersburg compared to Ukraine. And a similar distance to Moscow. If NATO wanted to they could have put Ballistic Missiles in those countries. NATO however is a defensive pact and so they didn't take that action. You are basically repeating Russian propaganda. Putin's actions were a land grab, pure and simple. Plus Ukraine is a sovereign country and they should have the right to join any alliance they choose.

More of ""their definition of strategic win and Ukrainian definition of victory aren't completely aligned"".

For Western countries, keeping Ukrainian rear going and civilian casualties minimalized isn't as much of a pressing need as for Ukraine, as horrible as it is.

USA seems more interested in maximizing damage to russia, as [Lloyd Austin said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/04/25/russia-weakened-lloyd-austin-ukraine-visit/), than ensuring Ukrainian victory ASAP:

>We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it cant do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine, Austin said.

Plus, there's an embargo on supplying tanks, jets and long-range weaponry, as [Macron said:](https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/news/2022/06/16/7141437/)

>French President Emmanuel Macron said that due to fears of involvement in the war with Russia, Western countries had agreed not to provide Ukraine with certain weapons.

>According to European Truth, Macron said this during a conversation with journalists in Kyiv on Thursday.

>""We are helping Ukraine defend itself, ***but we are not going to war with Russia, so it has been agreed not to supply certain weapons - including assault planes or tanks***, and President Zelensky is aware of this agreement,"" he said.

>The French president added that the West instead provided Ukraine with ammunition and ""certain types of equipment.""

>""And now they have also started to supply (self-propelled artillery) Ceasar. This will allow Ukraine to be more mobile and destroy the enemy from a distance,"" Macron said.

>In May, the media learned from sources that the White House was negotiating with Ukraine restrictions on the use of American weapons, particularly for purposes deep within Russia.

>At the same time, US President Joe Biden said that the United States did not plan to provide Ukraine with missile systems capable of hitting targets in Russia.

>These reports came amid discussions on the supply of long-range systems to Ukraine, especially rocket-propelled grenade launchers.

>However, in the end, the United States approved the transfer to Ukraine of four HIMARS MLRS, which are due to arrive by the end of June

So... as for me, future doesn't look quite so bright."

Calm those tits bud, you don't have to get mad about written history.  Since apparently facist can be thrown around at anyone, YOU'RE the facist.  I was there behind the Iron curtain, we all knew the Russians were overspending on military at least in part because of Reagan's hostile stance and military build up.  The Reagan Doctrine was an intentional strategy to cripple a weakened USSR economically, it certainly contributed to their downfall as they tried to compete with the incredibly expensive development of next generation nuclear delivery and defense.  In the end, he forged a friendship with Gorbachev that helped push glastnost and the end of the USSR.

BUT if Ukraine's missile is responsible, then they need to own up to it and take responsibility because it's the right thing to do. All this strange skulduggery and Zelensky flatly opposing both NATO and Poland's view is...I don't know, it's just odd.

Everyone knows that if Russia hadn't invaded there would be no Ukrainian missiles in the air at all, but if Ukraine made a mistake then they still need to own up to it. If there was a malfunction from poor maintenance, human error, bad programming or whatever else, that resulted in a Ukrainian missile killing Polish citizens, Ukraine should admit it, offer condolences, and pay reparations to the families. When the US, fighting against tyranny and fascism, bombed neutral Switzerland by mistake in WW2, they didn't just say ""not our fault, blame Hitler."" They paid reparations (albeit several years later). Likewise West Germany paid reparations to Ireland (also neutral in WW2) because the Luftwaffe (who conversely were fighting FOR tyranny and fascism at the time) bombed Dublin several times. It's justice for the families, it's the right thing to do morally, and it will continue to strengthen the already overwhelming evidence that Ukraine are acting in a righteous way and are the clear good guys.

If it was a Russian missile of course, then the families of the dead will probably never get any kind of justice at all."

Many standard (I do not know what a standard bridge is) bridges are restricted to a maximum of a 36 ton heavy load and for these special heavy loads you also need permission to do this. Simply put, an Abrams would not be allowed to cross these bridges.

Abrams are also not allow on paved roads as they would rip up the asphalt in a serious way.

So Ukraine, if they were to get these tanks, would need bridge layers to accompanying them, that can support 70 tons (aka the M104 Wolverine).

And if there is sufficient airstrip, a C-17 can transport an Abrams.

Just let you know the Leopard I (approx. 42 tons) can only cross 500-600 of Poland's bridges. One city itself, in Poland, has over 100 bridges."

Also, non-european people maybe miss the history behind it:

Until the year 1200 ac russian provinces developed according to northern-western europe. For example the province Novgorod was part of the [Hanse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanseatic_League)

This is mentioned in the video, but not everybody may know what it means for western european development.

It is similar of what happened later in Venezia (Venice) ... commerce always had a big impact on the development of civil rule and law, as it was carried out not by ""state actors"" but private people.

Anyway ...

Then, with the occupation of Russia by mongolian tribes from the east, a rather archaic rule establishes. These tribes did have no need for rule of law. It lasted for 300 years.

And this is a heritage until today, with a deep vertical hierarchy in the rule of the empire/state.

It also explains the corruption, because corruption is also mean of control over provinces ... as a ""substitute"" or ""in the absence"" of the rule of law.

2. He called Donetsk a Russian-backed separatist uprising.
That's not entirely wrong. I'll grant you it's an incomplete picture, but since we're going off what someone says about what someone else says, this is not good enough proof to me. When Ukraine threw out the Russian puppets, Donetsk had more people who were supporters of the previous administration than anywhere else.

There is some ""shizophrenia"" culture ... people never say what they think ... and they either do it to protect themselves or to gain advantage over you.

So there are at least 3 common words for ""truth"" in russia ... each one with a different ""spin"".

Within Germany the introduction of these trains was a desaster ...  
Financially and also practically.

They have a technology that makes it possible to ""lean into curves"".

This was a modern concept of the time of first generation development (1980/1990).

This will help with high speed in curves.

Turns out:

German railway tracks are built too close to each other.

There could be collisions with other trains coming from the opposite direction.

Also collision with signal poles in close range of the track.

Mostly this feature could not be used.  
One of the many reasons it is much slower than per specification.

If that was true Zelensky wouldn't have stated categorically that it was Russia the moment the news broke, and his Foreign Minister wouldn't have said it was ""russian propaganda"" to even speculate that it might have been a ukrainian anti-air missile.  This happened while every nato country ***was*** actually saying that it should be investigated before jumping to conclusions.

Now that he has egg on his face, Zelensky hasn't admitted he was wrong, he's demanded access to the site, to the evidence, and to the NATO meeting about the incident.  He's not waiting for evidence he's trying to insert himself in the investigation and decisions surrounding it to influence the outcome, and having been told he needs special approval for that, he has no other choice but to sit on his hands and wait, grudgingly saying he'll apologize if the decision comes down against him.

After hearing that NATO thinks it was his missiles, what leader would not be re-questioning his people and demanding accounting for every single piece of ordinance in an attempt to discern what might have gone wrong and who lied and covered up a mistake and made him look foolish, since he claims that his people told him it was not them.

Huh, trying to Google that, and it seems like you cant quickly do it, you need to take some time. Maybe its because I did so much reading when I was growing up? In particular with punctuation, thats largely how I learned, I would refer to what others had written, and how they did their punctuation. Funny, I looked for ways to understand, even as a child.

Iron Dome was designed to defend against an enemy who is spamming hundreds of low-tech unguided ballistic rockets. One of its best features is targeting software that automatically decides which rockets to intercept and which to leave alone by projecting the impact location and only wasting an interceptor on a rocket that is actually going to fall on a populated area. But that projection is based on the assumption that the incoming rocket is going to follow a ballistic trajectory. In addition, ballistic rockets fly up in a high arcing trajectory, which enables Iron Dome to intercept them at relatively high altitude.

None of these conditions apply to the threat Ukraine is facing. Cruise missiles and kamikaze drones do not follow a ballistic trajectory, they fly in at low altitude and are capable of independent maneuverability. Ukraine definitely needs more air defenses, but Iron Dome is the wrong tool to counter the threat they face."

Honestly, I can't understand what the Russians are even trying to do.  Attacks on civilians have never worked to stop a military conflict - with one exception.  The bombings on London didn't stop them from fighting in WW2, and neither did the bombing in Berlin stop the Germans.  The American firebombing of Japan?  Nope, not nearly enough.  

We had to nuke them.  Twice.

And, just in general, dumb bombing campaigns or artillery fire that isn't guided is terribly ineffective.  The British bombardment of German lines in the Battle of the Somme in WWI?  Seven days of shelling and over a million artillery rounds fired only for the British to charge and be slaughtered.  Operation Rolling Thunder in Vietnam?  Killed hundreds of thousands of people, most of which were civilian, and accomplished basically nothing in the end.

I am not even arguing ethics or morals here - I am pointing out that it just doesn't work.  If you can't accurately and consistently hit military targets you are just wasting your ammunition and time for little - if any - gain.  The one time it did work the weapons in question became so reviled worldwide that their very existence is nearly taboo, to say nothing of their actual use.

Look, collateral civilian deaths during strikes on valid military installations is something - well, ""accept"" isn't the right word - grudgingly acknowledge as something that is inevitable.  There is no military on earth that can fight a war without civilian casualties or committing some war crimes.  The between Russia and most other countries is that Russia isn't making mistakes and having a few men out of hundreds of thousands be terrible people - civilian death and war crimes are *their entire plan.*

Worse still, it wouldn't even be hard to have shot those missiles at the transportation infrastructure in western Ukraine.  A few shots at Ukraine's rail lines would do so much to help their front lines that it is genuinely perplexing that they haven't done it.  It is as incompetent as it is evil."

Russian assets throughout the west agree.

 The rarely come straight out and say ""no money to Ukraine"".  Instead, they question whether money is disappearing. It isn't. -  Or whether it's being spent properly.  It is.  Both the US and EU have verification and validation programs in place.

> Its also important to solve our many, many festering domestic problems. 

At least in the US, cutting Ukraine aid wouldn't move a dollar towards festering domestic problems.  This because Ukraine is a rare issue of bipartisan comity.   Festering domestic issues don't have the votes to pass the House and Senate.  Ukraine does.

If the goal is to fix festering domestic issues, make sure the Democrats win the House, Senate, and Presidency in 2024.  And the Senate by enough to kill the filibuster.  That's the only way those issues will see any funding.

>  The scale is tilted too far right now.

The west is receiving benefits that would be a bargain at 10 times the price.

Over the past 70 years, the west has spent *trillions*, yes, trillions, keeping the Russian bear at bay.  
 Ukraine is doing all the hard work, the west is merely providing the funding and weapons.  And the result will be a largely de-weaponized and defeated Russia.

This war should bring an end to Putin, and if we're lucky, an end to Russian dictatorship. Meaning one less power pointing nuclear missiles at the west, and a weakening of dictatorships the world over.

So yes,  funding Ukraine's defense is a bargain at ten times the price."

Also, Russia (embarrassingly) does not have total air control. Ukraine is operating aircraft successfully. This makes the net impact of the NFZ less significant than situations where one side has established total air superiority against an opponent with insufficient anti-aircraft systems, allowing them to bomb with impunity.

Basically it means that everyone is telling lies, and that everyone knows everyone is telling lies, but that everyone is going to act as if no one is telling lies.

It is honestly a little difficult to comprehend  because of the scale involved.  I was reading an Estonian article that discussed how the West views Russia, and they brought up the fact that we tend to think Russian culture is - at its core - like our own.  That Russian culture is like American or European culture, when really it is as different as China's.

Some of the people interviewed in the article posited that after so many centuries under brutal totalitarian regimes, that things as simple as ""lies are bad"" isnt something neccesarily obvious to them.  Russians have to lie constantly, about their opinions, about current events, about everything, because if they day the wrong thing they will be punished for it.

A good example is how Russian Youtubers who left before the war in Ukraine won't call it a war.  When one of them responded to the questions of why he wouldnt, his response was: ""If I called that a war, I would be breaking the law, and I really want to see my family again.""

Truth is dangerous in Russia, and has been for hundreds of years.  As a result, so long as that is true, Russia is inherently untrustworthy.

The cure would be to remove the authoritarianism and allow enough freedom for people to not fear the truth, but unfortunately other aspects of Russias history have also introduced mistrust and disgust for democracy and elections.  Russia still had *serfs* not all that long ago, and their first brush with elections happened a little before World War One and was crushed by the Czar.  Their second attempt was during World War One and can only be described as a disaster, which led to the rise of the Bolsheviks.

After that was the Communist government of the USSR until the 90's, where the Russian Federation's President gets into - how shall I put this - a bit of a tussle with the legislative branch that involved massive riots and tanks firing on the legislature itself.

And after that is Putin.

What is notable is that every time they have attempted democracy it has been during a time of chaos and poverty.  And Putin has spent years working to delegitimize the concept of democracy further.

So many Russians will actively fight against a system that would remove the fear at the heart of ""vranyo"" from their society.

Russian culture is a reminder that cultural relativism is a terrible idea - or at least the type of cultural relativism that suggests that we shouldn't judge other cultures."

You have to hope Russia wont intentionally violate it to either call your bluff and significantly damage your credibility for future NFZs, or force you to shoot down one of their aircraft so that they can escalate in other ways and use it for additional propaganda.

And what other reaction you would expect?

If it's declared as russian missile (intentional, or not - does matter), only NFZ - at least in some buffer area around NATO - Ukraine border is a sensible option. This village is right at the border, so it's not like we can go with ""oh we can wait until it crosses into NATO territory and then we can shoot it down"".

Easy as that - russian shit goes into buffer zone, it gets shot down because russian proven themselves as incapable of respecting borders of engagement. Their only salvation would be if NATO declares that it wasn't russian, but i.e. Ukrainian S-300 going stray."

>It is also possible to infer Russia's general negotiating position from the conversations viewed by NDR: Russia is prepared to address Ukraine if the West accepts its responsibility for what happened and is also prepared to talk about the sanctions imposed on Russia.
>
>Konstantin, the man in the negotiating team, comes to the assessment in the chat: How flexible the countries will be in Bali will strongly depend on the current situation that then prevails in Ukraine. The Russian Foreign Ministry left an inquiry from NDR unanswered.
>
>But shortly after Konstantin's optimistic news, skepticism is spreading among him. ""The Westerners are playing a double game,"" he writes to his superior Yuriy in a long message with eight subheadings. ""On the corridors, they continue with bridge-building, bringing into play possibilities of finding a compromise: that a formulation could be found without condemning Russia."" 
>
>But things would look different on the ""official track"" - that is, in the official part: There, the representatives of the West would continue to push their line that there is a need for formulations such as ""Russia's aggressive war"" and a reference to ""Russia's condemnation and acceptance of responsibility"" in the final declaration. Fortunately, Constantine lectures further, emerging economies ""have so far responded confidently to [Western] pressure.""
>
>From the course of the two men's chat, it is clear how much Russia relied on the countries of the so-called BRICS alliance - named after the first letters of the associated countries Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - to push through its goals in the run-up to the G20 summit.
>
>But apparently there was also frustration: In the course of the conversation, Konstantin complains with some strong language to his superior in the Russian Foreign Ministry that the other BRICS countries would not sufficiently follow the formulations proposed by Russia with regard to Ukraine. For example, the Russian negotiators had proposed the phrase ""a multiplicity of conflicts"" instead of directly mentioning the Ukraine war in the final paper.
>
>In terms of behind-the-scenes sentiment, other clues can be found in the chat history. Despite complaints about the West's ""double game,"" Konstantin notes, ""Our contacts with Westerners are normal, there are business talks and friendly conversations, almost like before."" However, he says, the Australians and Germans are an exception. ""Even with the Americans, communication turns out to be smooth, sometimes even informal."" He goes on to report that ""in front of the microphone"" the Germans and French in particular ""act sharply.""
>
>But the disillusionment seems to have solidified within just a few days: ""Westerners continue to insist that it is important that the issue [Ukraine] be reflected in all 'relevant' paragraphs,"" even when it comes to energy. The goal, he said, is ""to try to justify themselves to their own citizens for energy prices and the trade deficit."" Behind the scenes, Western representatives make no secret of this, Konstantin reports to his home country.
>
>At the end of October, he finally shares with his superior the third draft of the English-language declaration, which NDR was also able to view. ""Oh, the war is in it,"" he writes - in reference to a formulation in the second paragraph, in which, however, Russia is not accused. But his superior is still optimistic about it: ""Well, so far, for optics."" 
>
>While the summit is now underway, the wrangling over the final declaration continues. In a version of the text that became known on Tuesday, the words ""war in Ukraine"" are written. However, there is no direct attribution of blame to Russia by summit participants. Only a mention of the UN General Assembly finds its way in, addressing Russian aggression. For Konstantin, his colleague and the Russian delegation, things could probably have gone worse.

Make no mistake, if nato fumbles this one the risk of nuclear conflict goes way, way up.

The response must be swift, proportionate, but strategically very expensive for Russia.

It needs to hurt bad enough to be just a little scary and remove any doubt as to the unified response of nato.  The future of humanity may very well depend on it.

Sanitizing Ukrainian airspace within reach of the NATO border, for example. Destroying any launchers capable of reaching NATO cities if they go active.  That would be a proportionate response.

Russian forces were unable to put up any serious resistance due to the turmoil of the Russian Revolution and subsequent Russian Civil War. The armies of the Central Powers therefore captured huge territories in Estonia, Latvia, Belarus, and Ukraine, forcing the Bolshevik government of Russia to sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.

The Ukrainian armys 92nd Mechanized Brigade is killing Russian draftees as fast as the Kremlin can shove the unhappy, unfit conscripts to the front near the Russian-occupied town of Svatove, 30 miles northwest of Severodonetsk in eastern Ukraines Donbas region.

We are just fucking meat, just fucking meat, one draftee said in an intercepted phone call that popular social-media account @wartranslated helpfully interpreted for English speakers.

The call, reportedly with a member of the 362nd Motorized Rifle Regiment, paints a bleak picture for Russian draftees. The 362nd and a sister motorized regiment, the 346th, are under orders to hold the line around Svatove in order to slow, if not halt, the Ukrainian 92nd Mechanized Brigades march toward Severodonetsk, which Russian forces captured in July after months of hard fighting.

But the Russian regiments, partially staffed by some of the 300,000 men the Kremlin rounded up and forced into military service back in September, hopelessly are outmatched. We have nothing! the caller exclaimed. How can we fight against mortars and tanks?

The mismatch should come as no surprise. The 92nd Mechanized Brigade is a volunteer unit with well-maintained T-64 tanks and BTR fighting vehicles. Since the start of Russias wider war on Ukraine in February, the brigade has fought, and won, a series of battles in and around Kharkiv Oblast just north of Svatove. Now its got Severodonetsk in its sights.

The 362nd by contrast is as much a penal colony as it is a fighting formation. Its officers issue impossible orders and threaten the draftees with severe punishment if they retreat. After that, the officers disappear to the relative safety of the regiments rear area, leaving the untrained draftees to fight, without leadership, what arguably is the worlds most experienced mechanized brigade.

Posting to Svatove is a veritable death sentence for Russian conscripts. Our battalion commander was bullshitting that we need to hold for two weeks before replacement troops would arrive, the caller explained. How the fuck can we hold here for two weeks? The regiment lost 2,500 killedhalf its manpowerin just the previous 12 days, the caller claimed.

Now just 100 survivors are trying to hold positions that 2,500 men failed to hold earlier this month, he said. When they complained, their officers labeled them deserters and threatened them with prison sentences. And when 300 wounded men crawled away from the line of contact, the regiments officers declared them deserters, too.

Put us in prison, some of the draftees told their officers, according to the caller. Better prison than the grave.

The kicker, for the beleaguered Russians, is that their regular forces arent faring much better around Svatove. Yes, the regiments of lightly armed draftees are getting massacred. But so too are units operating modern T-72B3 tanks. Ukrainian troops captured three intacted T-72B3s from a muddy field outside Svatove on or before Wednesday.

So for instance Shoigu is pretty hawkish but less so than Putin, I'd say so is Naryshkin, and Medvedev too(yes I've heard the things he's said, it's a performance which shouldn't be taken very seriously by anyone on its own merits). So we can find people in the Kremlin who are less hawkish than the current leadership, and for instance if Medvedev or Shoigu came to power we could expect to see if not an outright attempt at a face saving withdrawal than steps to be taken towards de-escalation. However, the odds that either of them would be able to get anywhere close to power are extraordinarily low. So there are less extreme people who've been able to survive and even thrive in the Kremlin, but none of them are in a position to take control

Then what's your rationale for why the various religious bodies held on to this knowledge and made it accessible to scholars? If they were as ""anti-science"" as you're claiming, it would have been much easier and cheaper to simply burn the books and be done with it.

Keep in mind, this was an era where books needed to be replaced regularly due to bindings wearing out, mold or moisture damaging the works, etc., and doing so involved rewriting the entire book by hand (which, given the need for literate copyists to write out the book, edit it to correct any mistakes, bind it, and decorate it, made it extremely labour-intensive). Monks were generally the ones who performed this task, to the point where many monasteries had a purpose-built room for it called a scriptorium. 

>For example, you brought up the Islamic golden but seemed to skip over why it ended - clerics deciding math is of the devil. 

Oh, good grief, this shit again.

I didn't actually bring up the ""Islamic golden"", nor the Islamic Golden Age you were probably trying to refer to with that statement. 

I'm assuming you're referring to Abu Hamid Al-Ghazali with that reference and presumably either watched Neil deGrasse Tyson's video on the subject or read some summary of it. Hate to tell you, but if that's the case you got swindled - al Ghazali was a polymath and, ironically enough given the subject of our discussion, decried the suppression of knowledge based on religious lines (i.e. the idea that Muslims should not be studying non-Muslim academic works). He was very much not anti-math or anti-science and, in fact, spoke in defence of both subjects. Tyson really needs to learn to restrict his public elucidations to subjects he's actually an expert on - I'm sure he's brilliant at astrophysics, and he's probably forgotten more on that subject than I'll ever know, but he's quite obviously not a historian (and the general public should also be viewing these lectures with a degree of skepticism that is quite clearly absent - again noting that while Tyson is an academic, it's often not in the fields of study that he likes to talk about and his opinion should therefore be afforded no greater weight than that of any other layperson).

The end of the Islamic Golden Age had a lot more to do with Hulagu Khan and the Mongols coming along and wiping Bagdhad - at the time the seat of the Abbasid Caliphate, the centre of the Islamic world, and one of the greatest cities of the Middle Ages - off the map so thoroughly that it never recovered anywhere close to its prior glory than the (in this case incorrect) suggestion that some Imams decided they didn't like arithmetic (particularly ironic, given that Muslim scholars were at the forefront of mathematical development in this era, most notably in Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi's development of algebra, arithmetic, and trigonometry)."

The characters in general are written poorly and don't have much depth, but they aren't entirely flat. Several characters were reworked and/or merged. There's some timeline compression to fit the medium, of course; some of it works well enough, while other choices cut helpful context or else are simply puzzling. Some choices in general are puzzling (London comes to mind, but I don't want to spoil anything).

I found it entertaining enough even if it fails pretty miserably at being a worthy adaptation of the novel. It was definitely less awful than The Witcher adaptation in my opinion, although in a way it reminds me of what The Expanse might look like if created with The Witcher team and budget.

Also, they didn't randomly introduce magic into the universe like they did in Foundation, so that's a big plus.

As for the books The Peripheral was a breath of fresh air, but I did enjoy Blue Ant too (I love Milgrim in Spook Country) and the Bridge trilogy is under-appreciated imo.

Secret Russian negotiation documents and chat flows between members of the Russian negotiating delegation, which reporters from NDR were able to view, reveal Russia's strategy and show that the negotiators long did everything they could to keep terms like ""Ukraine"" or ""war"" out of the summit's final declaration. To do so, they also wanted to use their close contacts with supposed allies such as China, India and Brazil.

>Above all, the host, which in Bali is Indonesia, is trying to make a final declaration possible. The Russian delegation is also interested in finding a compromise. Thus, Yuriy writes to his colleague: ""For us, only one sentence is important: that states remember their own positions regarding the Ukrainian cause."" In this way, there would be no one-sided apportionment of blame. ""That would be a very nice outcome. But who knows whether Westerners will go for it,"" Yuriy added.

A couple of observations for what they are worth.  

russia doesn't get to wash its hands of liability for this situation because the ordnance wasn't theirs.  The effort at Ukrainian self defence wouldn't have been required or deadly without russia conducting itself as a terrorist state.  It does however  mean that the gathering of ambassadors due soon at Poland's behest is unlikely to be considering any Article 5 response.

The speed and effort russia adopted to cry innocence was evidence they well realise inviting such a response is suicidal and to be avoided at all costs.  Moreover, the enthusiasm shown by  many (who took this to be targeted russian aggression against a Nato member) to unleash  previously restrained dogs of war must have been salutary to them.  The notion that a force all but on their border is governed by people just looking for the opportunity to fuck them sideways must give pause for thought.

There are increasingly few good options for russia's military in this war but inviting a legally mandated curb stomping can't be the best.  Knowing your only response at that stage is to invite the incineration of your people and nation in a nuclear exchange rather emphasises the nature of their problem.  russia has invaded Ukraine but is now deep in darkest Zugzwang."
