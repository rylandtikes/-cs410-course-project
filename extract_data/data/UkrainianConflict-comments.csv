the russians, however, thats a different story"
1668574734.0,iwk0zyb,t5_30hhs,0,1,impy695,0,"I don't think he will use nukes in Ukraine, but I also don't think it's out of the realm of possibility as it wouldnt trigger MAD. It would isolate Russia even more than they are now and neutral parties and even allies would likely switch to Ukraines side over the war. It would be a massive military win in the short term but an even bigger loss long-term. The problem is, if he sees a large short term win as worth it, cares even less about long-term consequences, and/or he feels it would be able to be played well within Russsia.

Again, I don't think he will use nukes in Ukraine, I just think it's a realistic possibility."

Still don't think it's the kind of escalation they will want, but regardless it will pressure NATO members to react."
1668574747.0,iwk10q2,t5_30hhs,0,1,t-ritz,0,"I know we all have a hankering for NATO to step in and wipe Russia off the face of the earth, but I can’t see it happening.

If it was seen as a deliberate act on Poland, then maybe. But this is clearly an error by Russia. Poland with NATO will likely have some stern words for Russia, and pledge to step up support of Ukraine, but a war between NATO and Russia is too risky over this. Better to keep it as a proxy war to avoid losses on NATOs side, especially while the momentum is in Ukraines favour anyway."

2. Like everyone else I assume it was fired from the russian occupiers of Belarus."
1668574780.0,iwk12mh,t5_30hhs,0,1,Available-Sign1654,0,We got a Russian! NATO has done nothing and showed weakness? Not even the pundits like Solyev on Russian Media think that! They complain they are losing BECAUSE OF NATO! They would complain to YOU that NATO troops are ALREADY fighting in Ukraine! The Ukrainians fight because they CHOOSE to. They don't need barrier troops or to lock men in basements to get them to fight. Now why aren't you fighting for Russia right now? You know Putin has even signed laws to allow foreigners to fight. Go fight weapons manufacturers you hate so much!
