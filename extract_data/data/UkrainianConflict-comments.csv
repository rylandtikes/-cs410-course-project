Now? Modern nuclear warheads that are equipped on fighter jets pack **300 KT** or **x18** the power of those strategic weapons used back in WW2 and there are **tens of thousands of them.**


Now let's talk about the continent destoryers. The B83 Nuclear Bomb (ICBM) is a variable yield strategic weapon with an output of **1,200 KT** or **x75** the power of the weapons used to end WW2. 


**there are thousands of them in the active arsenal of the US.**

Whatever the response, It'll be well measured and considered.  Preferably they want Russia to take responsibility and pay reparations. If not they will ultimately want to plan out something that shows they respond to the exact threat presented against NATO but doesn't necessarily trigger Russia to escalate with a response to the response.

No one said it wasn't clear who fired it, only that it likely wasn't fired from Russian territory... which makes sense, since Belarus is MUCH closer to the impact site than Russia is. There isn't any reason *right now* to think it's an S-300, but figuring out the type of missile should be very easy for the Polish government... which seems to think Russia is responsible."

You would need to be 100% prepared to shoot down Russian aircraft without flinching. You have to hope Russia won’t intentionally violate it to either call your bluff and significantly damage your credibility for future NFZs, or force you to shoot down one of their aircraft so that they can escalate in other ways and use it for additional propaganda. 

Also, Russia (embarrassingly) does not have total air control. Ukraine is operating aircraft successfully. This makes the net impact of the NFZ less significant than situations where one side has established total air superiority against an opponent with insufficient anti-aircraft systems, allowing them to bomb with impunity. I am pretty that was how Russia planned for it to go, in which case a NFZ would be helpful, but still a dicey proclamation due to the reasons I mentioned above.

Giving Ukraine more advanced weapons with greater range and power that were previously withheld would be a more measured response."

You would need to be 100% prepared to shoot down Russian aircraft without flinching. You have to hope Russia won’t intentionally violate it to either call your bluff and significantly damage your credibility for future NFZs, or force you to shoot down one of their aircraft so that they can escalate in other ways and use it for additional propaganda.

And what other reaction you would expect?

If it's declared as russian missile (intentional, or not - does matter), only NFZ - at least in some buffer area around NATO - Ukraine border is a sensible option. This village is right at the border, so it's not like we can go with ""oh we can wait until it crosses into NATO territory and then we can shoot it down"".

Easy as that - russian shit goes into buffer zone, it gets shot down because russian proven themselves as incapable of respecting borders of engagement. Their only salvation would be if NATO declares that it wasn't russian, but i.e. Ukrainian S-300 going stray."

1668580620.0,iwk9ui6,t5_30hhs,0,1,Acrobatic-Till5092,0,"""Vranyo"" doesnt really translate well.  I learned it from a Perun video and then looked up myself, perhaps the most concise translation would be: ""a culture of knowing lies.""

Basically it means that everyone is telling lies, and that everyone knows everyone is telling lies, but that everyone is going to act as if no one is telling lies.

It is honestly a little difficult to comprehend  because of the scale involved.  I was reading an Estonian article that discussed how the West views Russia, and they brought up the fact that we tend to think Russian culture is - at its core - like our own.  That Russian culture is like American or European culture, when really it is as different as China's.

Some of the people interviewed in the article posited that after so many centuries under brutal totalitarian regimes, that things as simple as ""lies are bad"" isnt something neccesarily obvious to them.  Russians have to lie constantly, about their opinions, about current events, about everything, because if they day the wrong thing they will be punished for it.

A good example is how Russian Youtubers who left before the war in Ukraine won't call it a war.  When one of them responded to the questions of why he wouldnt, his response was: ""If I called that a war, I would be breaking the law, and I really want to see my family again.""

Truth is dangerous in Russia, and has been for hundreds of years.  As a result, so long as that is true, Russia is inherently untrustworthy.

The cure would be to remove the authoritarianism and allow enough freedom for people to not fear the truth, but unfortunately other aspects of Russias history have also introduced mistrust and disgust for democracy and elections.  Russia still had *serfs* not all that long ago, and their first brush with elections happened a little before World War One and was crushed by the Czar.  Their second attempt was during World War One and can only be described as a disaster, which led to the rise of the Bolsheviks.

After that was the Communist government of the USSR until the 90's, where the Russian Federation's President gets into - how shall I put this - a bit of a tussle with the legislative branch that involved massive riots and tanks firing on the legislature itself.

And after that is Putin.

What is notable is that every time they have attempted democracy it has been during a time of chaos and poverty.  And Putin has spent years working to delegitimize the concept of democracy further.

So many Russians will actively fight against a system that would remove the fear at the heart of ""vranyo"" from their society.

Russian culture is a reminder that cultural relativism is a terrible idea - or at least the type of cultural relativism that suggests that we shouldn't judge other cultures."

The name refers to the fact that the missile itself is only a passive detector of a radar signal—provided by an external (""offboard"") source—as it reflects off the target (in contrast to active radar homing, which uses an active radar transceiver). Semi-active missile systems use bistatic continuous-wave radar. The NATO brevity code for a semi-active radar homing missile launch is Fox One.

Iron Dome was designed to defend against an enemy who is spamming hundreds of low-tech unguided ballistic rockets. One of its best features is targeting software that automatically decides which rockets to intercept and which to leave alone by projecting the impact location and only wasting an interceptor on a rocket that is actually going to fall on a populated area. But that projection is based on the assumption that the incoming rocket is going to follow a ballistic trajectory. In addition, ballistic rockets fly up in a high arcing trajectory, which enables Iron Dome to intercept them at relatively high altitude.

None of these conditions apply to the threat Ukraine is facing. Cruise missiles and kamikaze drones do not follow a ballistic trajectory, they fly in at low altitude and are capable of independent maneuverability. Ukraine definitely needs more air defenses, but Iron Dome is the wrong tool to counter the threat they face."

Russian assets throughout the west agree.

 The rarely come straight out and say ""no money to Ukraine"".  Instead, they question whether money is disappearing. It isn't. -  Or whether it's being spent properly.  It is.  Both the US and EU have verification and validation programs in place.

> It’s also important to solve our many, many festering domestic problems. 

At least in the US, cutting Ukraine aid wouldn't move a dollar towards festering domestic problems.  This because Ukraine is a rare issue of bipartisan comity.   Festering domestic issues don't have the votes to pass the House and Senate.  Ukraine does.

If the goal is to fix festering domestic issues, make sure the Democrats win the House, Senate, and Presidency in 2024.  And the Senate by enough to kill the filibuster.  That's the only way those issues will see any funding.

>  The scale is tilted too far right now.

The west is receiving benefits that would be a bargain at 10 times the price.

Over the past 70 years, the west has spent *trillions*, yes, trillions, keeping the Russian bear at bay.  
 Ukraine is doing all the hard work, the west is merely providing the funding and weapons.  And the result will be a largely de-weaponized and defeated Russia.

This war should bring an end to Putin, and if we're lucky, an end to Russian dictatorship. Meaning one less power pointing nuclear missiles at the west, and a weakening of dictatorships the world over.

So yes,  funding Ukraine's defense is a bargain at ten times the price."

Honestly, I can't understand what the Russians are even trying to do.  Attacks on civilians have never worked to stop a military conflict - with one exception.  The bombings on London didn't stop them from fighting in WW2, and neither did the bombing in Berlin stop the Germans.  The American firebombing of Japan?  Nope, not nearly enough.  

We had to nuke them.  Twice.

And, just in general, dumb bombing campaigns or artillery fire that isn't guided is terribly ineffective.  The British bombardment of German lines in the Battle of the Somme in WWI?  Seven days of shelling and over a million artillery rounds fired only for the British to charge and be slaughtered.  Operation Rolling Thunder in Vietnam?  Killed hundreds of thousands of people, most of which were civilian, and accomplished basically nothing in the end.

I am not even arguing ethics or morals here - I am pointing out that it just doesn't work.  If you can't accurately and consistently hit military targets you are just wasting your ammunition and time for little - if any - gain.  The one time it did work the weapons in question became so reviled worldwide that their very existence is nearly taboo, to say nothing of their actual use.

Look, collateral civilian deaths during strikes on valid military installations is something - well, ""accept"" isn't the right word - grudgingly acknowledge as something that is inevitable.  There is no military on earth that can fight a war without civilian casualties or committing some war crimes.  The between Russia and most other countries is that Russia isn't making mistakes and having a few men out of hundreds of thousands be terrible people - civilian death and war crimes are *their entire plan.*

Worse still, it wouldn't even be hard to have shot those missiles at the transportation infrastructure in western Ukraine.  A few shots at Ukraine's rail lines would do so much to help their front lines that it is genuinely perplexing that they haven't done it.  It is as incompetent as it is evil."

The initial accusation came quickly and was very likely made (prematurely) before Kiyv had the information. They assumed, I don't think they lied. We are talking two hours or less, then night.

In the morning the clarifications are now being made.

Not sure who actually knew first. I think the US probably is tracking the Ukrainian airspace better than Ukrainians or Poles. So the Pentagon probably knew before Kiyv did. The Poles probably could have made the call late in the evening too, after surveying the wreckage. Though that's a bit technical, so it's again possible the information didn't quite make it to the politicians in time."

Particularly with pointing out that while Biden said preliminary information showed it wasn’t fired from Russia, that doesn’t rule out the Russians firing it from somewhere else, be it a Russian jet flying over Ukraine or Belarus.

A couple of observations for what they are worth.  

russia doesn't get to wash its hands of liability for this situation because the ordnance wasn't theirs.  The effort at Ukrainian self defence wouldn't have been required or deadly without russia conducting itself as a terrorist state.  It does however  mean that the gathering of ambassadors due soon at Poland's behest is unlikely to be considering any Article 5 response.

The speed and effort russia adopted to cry innocence was evidence they well realise inviting such a response is suicidal and to be avoided at all costs.  Moreover, the enthusiasm shown by  many (who took this to be targeted russian aggression against a Nato member) to unleash  previously restrained dogs of war must have been salutary to them.  The notion that a force all but on their border is governed by people just looking for the opportunity to fuck them sideways must give pause for thought.

There are increasingly few good options for russia's military in this war but inviting a legally mandated curb stomping can't be the best.  Knowing your only response at that stage is to invite the incineration of your people and nation in a nuclear exchange rather emphasises the nature of their problem.  russia has invaded Ukraine but is now deep in darkest Zugzwang."

If it was a Ukrainian missile following a Russian missile or drone, that doesn’t mean Russia is good, doesn’t mean they didn’t commit tens of thousands of war crimes, doesn’t mean they don’t deserve to be pushed out of Ukraine’s borders and tried in court for their crimes.

This is not an anti-Ukraine position. It’s just a pro-truth position.

And we even had the ministers of foreign affairs [claiming this was a conspiracy theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/ywboeb/the_russian_conspiracy_theory_about_the_fall_of/) earlier today:

>	“Russia is currently promoting a conspiracy theory that a Ukrainian air defense missile allegedly fell on the Poles. This is not true. No one should buy Russian propaganda or amplify its message. This lesson should have been learned long ago after the downing of MH17,”

Ukraine should win. Russia is acting like a terrorist state, kidnapping children, committing genocide, and every war crime in the book. But that doesn’t mean we should become blind. We should still wait for evidence, and be honest and careful in forming our own positions about things."

>At the end of September, about seven weeks before the start of the G20 summit in Bali, Konstantin* sees Russia already on the home stretch and writes a message. As a member of the delegation participating in the G20 preliminary negotiations on behalf of Russia, he feels that ""something is really happening."" He said his colleague and he were ""constantly being courted by Westerners.""
>
>Again and again, Konstantin said, representatives of Western countries stressed the importance of agreeing on a final declaration. At the end of his message he puts four closing brackets - common among Russian speakers instead of laughing emojis. The message goes to Yuriy*, who is his superior and apparently works in the Russian Foreign Ministry.
>
>For months, there has been behind-the-scenes wrangling over a final declaration for the G20 summit in Bali, one of the most important political summits in the world. Secret Russian negotiation documents and chat flows between members of the Russian negotiating delegation, which reporters from NDR were able to view, reveal Russia's strategy and show that the negotiators long did everything they could to keep terms like ""Ukraine"" or ""war"" out of the summit's final declaration. To do so, they also wanted to use their close contacts with supposed allies such as China, India and Brazil.
>
>The content of the documents, the names mentioned and the chronological sequence are plausible, even if their concrete truth content cannot be definitively verified. Formulations from a draft of the final declaration, for example, which the negotiators exchanged among themselves, match those from a draft published later.
>
>At such summits, it is common for all participating states to struggle for weeks or even months to reach a final summit declaration. In most cases, all countries try to reach a joint declaration and still accommodate important statements of their own without upsetting the other participants.
>
>Above all, the host, which in Bali is Indonesia, is trying to make a final declaration possible. The Russian delegation is also interested in finding a compromise. Thus, Yuriy writes to his colleague: ""For us, only one sentence is important: that states remember their own positions regarding the Ukrainian cause."" In this way, there would be no one-sided apportionment of blame. ""That would be a very nice outcome. But who knows whether Westerners will go for it,"" Yuriy added.
>
>At the time of the exchange between the two men, the Russian side is betting that at least Russian responsibility for the war will not find its way into the final declaration.

>It is also possible to infer Russia's general negotiating position from the conversations viewed by NDR: Russia is prepared to address Ukraine if the West accepts its responsibility for what happened and is also prepared to talk about the sanctions imposed on Russia.
>
>Konstantin, the man in the negotiating team, comes to the assessment in the chat: How flexible the countries will be in Bali will strongly depend on the current situation that then prevails in Ukraine. The Russian Foreign Ministry left an inquiry from NDR unanswered.
>
>But shortly after Konstantin's optimistic news, skepticism is spreading among him. ""The Westerners are playing a double game,"" he writes to his superior Yuriy in a long message with eight subheadings. ""On the corridors, they continue with bridge-building, bringing into play possibilities of finding a compromise: that a formulation could be found without condemning Russia."" 
>
>But things would look different on the ""official track"" - that is, in the official part: There, the representatives of the West would continue to push their line that there is a need for formulations such as ""Russia's aggressive war"" and a reference to ""Russia's condemnation and acceptance of responsibility"" in the final declaration. Fortunately, Constantine lectures further, emerging economies ""have so far responded confidently to [Western] pressure.""
>
>From the course of the two men's chat, it is clear how much Russia relied on the countries of the so-called BRICS alliance - named after the first letters of the associated countries Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - to push through its goals in the run-up to the G20 summit.
>
>But apparently there was also frustration: In the course of the conversation, Konstantin complains with some strong language to his superior in the Russian Foreign Ministry that the other BRICS countries would not sufficiently follow the formulations proposed by Russia with regard to Ukraine. For example, the Russian negotiators had proposed the phrase ""a multiplicity of conflicts"" instead of directly mentioning the Ukraine war in the final paper.
>
>In terms of behind-the-scenes sentiment, other clues can be found in the chat history. Despite complaints about the West's ""double game,"" Konstantin notes, ""Our contacts with Westerners are normal, there are business talks and friendly conversations, almost like before."" However, he says, the Australians and Germans are an exception. ""Even with the Americans, communication turns out to be smooth, sometimes even informal."" He goes on to report that ""in front of the microphone"" the Germans and French in particular ""act sharply.""
>
>But the disillusionment seems to have solidified within just a few days: ""Westerners continue to insist that it is important that the issue [Ukraine] be reflected in all 'relevant' paragraphs,"" even when it comes to energy. The goal, he said, is ""to try to justify themselves to their own citizens for energy prices and the trade deficit."" Behind the scenes, Western representatives make no secret of this, Konstantin reports to his home country.
>
>At the end of October, he finally shares with his superior the third draft of the English-language declaration, which NDR was also able to view. ""Oh, the war is in it,"" he writes - in reference to a formulation in the second paragraph, in which, however, Russia is not accused. But his superior is still optimistic about it: ""Well, so far, for optics."" 
>
>While the summit is now underway, the wrangling over the final declaration continues. In a version of the text that became known on Tuesday, the words ""war in Ukraine"" are written. However, there is no direct attribution of blame to Russia by summit participants. Only a mention of the UN General Assembly finds its way in, addressing Russian aggression. For Konstantin, his colleague and the Russian delegation, things could probably have gone worse.

The “accident” will allow them to know if  they can contemplate tactical nuclear weapons, their only chance of winning the war. It’s unlikely this was an accident, but even if it was, it has exactly the same effect.

Make no mistake, if nato fumbles this one the risk of nuclear conflict goes way, way up.

The response must be swift, proportionate, but strategically very expensive for Russia.

It needs to hurt bad enough to be just a little scary and remove any doubt as to the unified response of nato.  The future of humanity may very well depend on it.

Sanitizing Ukrainian airspace within reach of the NATO border, for example. Destroying any launchers capable of reaching NATO cities if they go active.  That would be a proportionate response.

The minimum response required to ensure that no more missiles can go into NATO airspace, since Russia apparently can’t ensure that on their own."

Then what's your rationale for why the various religious bodies held on to this knowledge and made it accessible to scholars? If they were as ""anti-science"" as you're claiming, it would have been much easier and cheaper to simply burn the books and be done with it.

Keep in mind, this was an era where books needed to be replaced regularly due to bindings wearing out, mold or moisture damaging the works, etc., and doing so involved rewriting the entire book by hand (which, given the need for literate copyists to write out the book, edit it to correct any mistakes, bind it, and decorate it, made it extremely labour-intensive). Monks were generally the ones who performed this task, to the point where many monasteries had a purpose-built room for it called a scriptorium. 

>For example, you brought up the Islamic golden but seemed to skip over why it ended - clerics deciding math is of the devil. 

Oh, good grief, this shit again.

I didn't actually bring up the ""Islamic golden"", nor the Islamic Golden Age you were probably trying to refer to with that statement. 

I'm assuming you're referring to Abu Hamid Al-Ghazali with that reference and presumably either watched Neil deGrasse Tyson's video on the subject or read some summary of it. Hate to tell you, but if that's the case you got swindled - al Ghazali was a polymath and, ironically enough given the subject of our discussion, decried the suppression of knowledge based on religious lines (i.e. the idea that Muslims should not be studying non-Muslim academic works). He was very much not anti-math or anti-science and, in fact, spoke in defence of both subjects. Tyson really needs to learn to restrict his public elucidations to subjects he's actually an expert on - I'm sure he's brilliant at astrophysics, and he's probably forgotten more on that subject than I'll ever know, but he's quite obviously not a historian (and the general public should also be viewing these lectures with a degree of skepticism that is quite clearly absent - again noting that while Tyson is an academic, it's often not in the fields of study that he likes to talk about and his opinion should therefore be afforded no greater weight than that of any other layperson).

The end of the Islamic Golden Age had a lot more to do with Hulagu Khan and the Mongols coming along and wiping Bagdhad - at the time the seat of the Abbasid Caliphate, the centre of the Islamic world, and one of the greatest cities of the Middle Ages - off the map so thoroughly that it never recovered anywhere close to its prior glory than the (in this case incorrect) suggestion that some Imams decided they didn't like arithmetic (particularly ironic, given that Muslim scholars were at the forefront of mathematical development in this era, most notably in Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi's development of algebra, arithmetic, and trigonometry)."

The characters in general are written poorly and don't have much depth, but they aren't entirely flat. Several characters were reworked and/or merged. There's some timeline compression to fit the medium, of course; some of it works well enough, while other choices cut helpful context or else are simply puzzling. Some choices in general are puzzling (London comes to mind, but I don't want to spoil anything).

I found it entertaining enough even if it fails pretty miserably at being a worthy adaptation of the novel. It was definitely less awful than The Witcher adaptation in my opinion, although in a way it reminds me of what The Expanse might look like if created with The Witcher team and budget.

Also, they didn't randomly introduce magic into the universe like they did in Foundation, so that's a big plus.

As for the books The Peripheral was a breath of fresh air, but I did enjoy Blue Ant too (I love Milgrim in Spook Country) and the Bridge trilogy is under-appreciated imo.

Like cmon dude, Ukraine is winning right now, but they're never going to invade Russia. Instant loss of all NATO backing, possible nuclear involvement, that is an absolutely braindead take. 

People want peace because as wars drag on, people die. Putin started this, he's conscripting people to carry it out, people are dying every day and a country is being turned into ruins. There are people who will NOT die if peace is made tomorrow. There are people who will NOT die if peace is made in 2 weeks, 2 months, 2 years. Pick how many people you want to save, every day the war goes on, more people die. Ukraine makes the call on the when, and if they want to push back to their internationally recognized border (including Crimea) then sure. I supported my country backing them in their defense, as soon as they go offensive and step onto sovereign ground of Russia, I'm out. Sorry but I do not support invading a nuclear state, it will only further push us towards a global conflict many orders of magnitude more severe than what we have now.

I want people to stop dying, be able to return to their homes, and live the rest of their lives in peace. Whatever gets us to that point I support, if Russia is losing and wants to talk now, get them to the table. Start the negotiations.

The Ukrainian army’s 92nd Mechanized Brigade is killing Russian draftees as fast as the Kremlin can shove the unhappy, unfit conscripts to the front near the Russian-occupied town of Svatove, 30 miles northwest of Severodonetsk in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region.

“We are just fucking meat, just fucking meat,” one draftee said in an intercepted phone call that popular social-media account @wartranslated helpfully interpreted for English speakers.

The call, reportedly with a member of the 362nd Motorized Rifle Regiment, paints a bleak picture for Russian draftees. The 362nd and a sister motorized regiment, the 346th, are under orders to hold the line around Svatove in order to slow, if not halt, the Ukrainian 92nd Mechanized Brigade’s march toward Severodonetsk, which Russian forces captured in July after months of hard fighting.

But the Russian regiments, partially staffed by some of the 300,000 men the Kremlin rounded up and forced into military service back in September, hopelessly are outmatched. “We have nothing!” the caller exclaimed. “How can we fight against mortars and tanks?”

The mismatch should come as no surprise. The 92nd Mechanized Brigade is a volunteer unit with well-maintained T-64 tanks and BTR fighting vehicles. Since the start of Russia’s wider war on Ukraine in February, the brigade has fought, and won, a series of battles in and around Kharkiv Oblast just north of Svatove. Now it’s got Severodonetsk in its sights.

The 362nd by contrast is as much a penal colony as it is a fighting formation. Its officers issue impossible orders and threaten the draftees with severe punishment if they retreat. After that, the officers disappear to the relative safety of the regiment’s rear area, leaving the untrained draftees to fight, without leadership, what arguably is the world’s most experienced mechanized brigade.

Posting to Svatove is a veritable death sentence for Russian conscripts. “Our battalion commander was bullshitting that we need to hold for two weeks” before replacement troops would arrive, the caller explained. “How the fuck can we hold here for two weeks?” The regiment lost 2,500 killed—half its manpower—in just the previous 12 days, the caller claimed.

Now just 100 survivors are trying to hold positions that 2,500 men failed to hold earlier this month, he said. When they complained, their officers labeled them deserters and threatened them with prison sentences. And when 300 wounded men crawled away from the line of contact, the regiment’s officers declared them deserters, too.

“Put us in prison,” some of the draftees told their officers, according to the caller. Better prison than the grave.

The kicker, for the beleaguered Russians, is that their regular forces aren’t faring much better around Svatove. Yes, the regiments of lightly armed draftees are getting massacred. But so too are units operating modern T-72B3 tanks. Ukrainian troops captured three intacted T-72B3s from a muddy field outside Svatove on or before Wednesday.

So for instance Shoigu is pretty hawkish but less so than Putin, I'd say so is Naryshkin, and Medvedev too(yes I've heard the things he's said, it's a performance which shouldn't be taken very seriously by anyone on its own merits). So we can find people in the Kremlin who are less hawkish than the current leadership, and for instance if Medvedev or Shoigu came to power we could expect to see if not an outright attempt at a face saving withdrawal than steps to be taken towards de-escalation. However, the odds that either of them would be able to get anywhere close to power are extraordinarily low. So there are less extreme people who've been able to survive and even thrive in the Kremlin, but none of them are in a position to take control

I'm not familiar with any, though I don't claim encyclopedic knowledge on the subject. Care to provide an example?

>and what kind of ""education"" was encouraged anyway?

Intellectual enlightenment was considered a path to godliness in those times, which is why it was a codified part of a monk's living. Part of why monasteries became de facto copy-houses and churches founded and maintained many of the world's libraries in the first millennium AD was due to monks copying out reference texts for use in their studies and contemplations (pre-Christian texts and works of knowledge from antiquity were considered invaluable to contextualize religious scripture). That gave them levels of literacy and skills in book production that were rare in the Middle Ages (book production being a much, much more labour-intensive task in the age before the printing press) and their scope of preservation gradually broadened.

>if scientific progress was widely propagated anywhere in the middle ages,it definitely wasnt in the sphere of influence of the book burning,script hoarding catholic church 

Kind of odd that your emoji-laden screed is zeroing in on the catholic church when I was referencing a much wider body of institutions than just them, but you do you.

>you do not propagate science by picking and choosing what results you like and tucking everything else away

Which the church generally didn't do. Think about what you're saying - in that era, due to the fact that there was no such thing as ""atmospheric controls"" or proper seals on houses, moisture damage, mold, and other environmental conditions quickly degraded books and other texts, necessitating that they had to be constantly re-copied. You're saying that the church, rather than either destroying these works or just letting nature run its course, decided instead to seal them away yet bizarrely still go through the rather arduous process of maintaining them? That makes zero sense.

Also, if we're being technical, yes, you do propagate science that way. For one, results that are considered erroneous or poorly founded get discarded all the time - that's a normal part of the scientific method. For two, even discounting that, science is still being propagated the way you've phrased it - just not in its entirety.

>to this day paywalls and elitist for profit capture hinder true scientific progress,and that was many times worse back then

I don't disagree, but I also don't think it furthers your point. Education was the domain of the rich and privileged for most of human history, largely because for most of human history we didn't have the tools needed to conduct mass education (hard to educate an entire populace when 90+% of them are needed for food production and distribution, and where a single copy of a book takes months if not years of multiple peoples' work to produce). 

Some historical perspective is in order to contextualize this viewpoint."

Because Russia and the U.S. both have a recession does not mean the two recessions are the same.

Of course we can't rule out that NATO is actually telling the truth, but there are several valid arguments to doubt this statement from the US and Poland.

Probably the only reason why the Dutch government gave in and we did end up having a rare period of mourning was to show the world we did care about the fact so many (Dutch) people were just murdered in cold blood by Russia. 

And even after that I feel like we didn't do enough to try and get justice for the victims.

&#x200B;

there's an agressor and a defender in this story. and that changes the perception of the impact completely. ukraine has no choice but to defend itself, and if during it's defense a missile malfunctions, there's a reduced blame. because that missile wouldn't have been fired if there was no threat to ukraine. russia is in the offender corner, though.

&#x200B;

russia fires missiles dileberatly to harm ukraine. which then forces ukraine to defend itself quite literally by all means possible. if the missile was fired by russia, then russia is the one that initiated the action, russia is the one that opted for a flight path that directed the missile over poland. russia is the one to blame for intruding on sovereign soil."

Her hatred of lgbtq people is extremely well documented, here's her Wikipedia entry on the subject:    

>Meloni has opposed the 1993 Mancino law [it], a hate speech law. She is opposed to the DDL Zan, an anti-homophobia law that would expand the Mancino law to cover LGBT discrimination, declaring in 2020 that ""there is no homophobia"" in Italy. She is also opposed to surrogacy, which is pejoratively known in Italian as utero in affitto, and she has pushed in Parliament for a law to make it a ""universal crime"". Meloni is supportive of the anti-gender movement, based on Catholic theology in the 1990s that condemns social positions not approved by the Catholic Church, including gender studies, and she is sceptical of what she calls ""gender ideology"";she says it is being taught in schools and that it attacks female identity and motherhood. She is supportive of changing the Constitution of Italy in order to make it illegal for same-sex couples to adopt children.

The Soviets expected the battlefield to be alternately nuclear contaminated or not, and their IFVs allowed fighting whether enclosed or dismounted. The Germans focused on anti-air accompaniment for tanks, as the tank's biggest enemy is aircraft. Only if the battlefield is uncontaminated would you be worried about infantry rushing your tanks, at which point German IFVs would dismount as well. The Americans took care of enemy aircraft with aircraft of their own, meaning APCs would be sufficient to accompany tanks, disembarking only if enemy troops tried to rush. For that reason the U.S. was the last to field a dedicated IFV."

As always there is more than one viewpoint. Russia deserves the condemnation for invading, but let's not pretend the US is innocent in all this. They gave verbal assurances which while not a formal treaty, still means something and it helped bring about a mostly peaceful end to the cold war. 

Instead of helping integrate post communist Russia, they hung them out to dry and expanded NATO eastwards at every opportunity. Using this ""strictly defensive alliance"" to take offensive actions in the Balkan war. And then we wonder why Russia is on constantly on edge.

What it shows to me is that there is evidence that the missiles were there in Belarus, there was recent transport and movement of those missiles to an airfield in range, and satellite imagery confirmed Belarus launchers able to launch them. Ok so, there is that.

But I tend to combine this with other evidence that Ukraine hadn't modified their S-300's for ground to ground, only Russia had. And further, that all Ukrainian S-300's were expressly programmed to blow up in mid air if they missed their target. 

Together that is still not conclusive, but it does cast at least some doubt that the S-300's in Poland were Ukrainian. And that's as far as I can go. Investigations are needed before this is written off as a Ukrainian mistake. And Zelensky is being pretty adamant that they are NOT Ukrainian. That may be why- cause his would have blown up in mid air instead of hitting the ground and exploding."

&#x200B;

i'm not gonna state you're either right or wrong. this event might be an absolute tragedy in the case a ukrainian air defense missile malfunctioned, or an action with hostile intent if russia knowingly fired a missile as the agressor which they knew might malfunction.

&#x200B;

i will leave you with this.

&#x200B;

52.018561, 23.794991

&#x200B;

this is a large military base in Brest, Belarus. russians have been using bases across belarus for their invasion. first for their invasion towards kyiv and chernihiv. when that failed, they used airfields to launch jets from. they have launched shahed drones and cruise missiles from belarus throughout this war. belarus is a russian ally, and russia has full military acces to belarus. this is simple fact. you're aware of this. 

&#x200B;

49°55'19.0""N 23°43'08.9""E

&#x200B;

this is a depot in ivano-frankove (not ivano-frankivske, that's further to the south, south east, this one is just west of lviv) if you go into streetview, you can see this depot has the emblem of the ukrainian military on it's wall. ukraine stores vehicles here. no doubt about it.

&#x200B;

if you were to draw a line, between that base in brest, belarus. and the depot in ivano frankovske. guess where that line passes over.infact, just go ahead and use the distance measuring tool in google maps to draw a line between those coordinates.

&#x200B;

now, we also know that russia uses S-300 missiles that they've modified to strike ground targets. essentially turning the S-300 missile into a ballistic missile. it's not easy to do so. not everyone that has the S-300 system has the know-how to do that. but russia has a dedicated team of 20 people that reprogram these missiles in order to strike ground targets. 

&#x200B;

[https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2022/10/24/the-remote-control-killers-behind-russias-cruise-missile-strikes-on-ukraine/](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2022/10/24/the-remote-control-killers-behind-russias-cruise-missile-strikes-on-ukraine/)

&#x200B;

that reprogramming isn't something simple apperently. and there's a small group of russian military personel that handles the input of coordinates for those missiles.

&#x200B;

take a look at the coordinates for kyiv. you'll find kyiv is on the same easting as the town in poland that was struck. take a look at the coordinates for lviv. you'll find lviv is on the same northing as the polish town was struck. simply put, if you take the northing from lviv, and the easting from kyiv. you end up with a coordinate that brings you near the town in poland that was hit. who'se to say those goons didn't get their coordinates mixed up?

&#x200B;

so next, concider how the USA and NATO might view an adequate response to either scenario. russia lobs a missile at ukraine that lands in poland. or ukraine lobs a missile in self defence that tragically malfunctions and lands in poland. what's the easier scenario to sell without resorting to conflict?

  
in the case of russia lobbing a missile with hostile intent that misses its target and lands in poland, assurances and guarantees have to be put in place to prevent that scenario from happening again. ergo, on the high end of the response spectrum there's a no fly zone option. anything over ukraine, belarus or russia that comes towards nato and is considered hostile is shot out of the sky. either by AA, jets or any other option. at the middle end of that spectrum is establishing an air defense shield on the polish border that reaches out over the border, into belarus and ukraine, and shoots down anything that's considered hostile. on the low end of that spectrum is establishing an air defense shield along the polish border that shoots down anything that actually crosses into polish territory. that's a huge fucking thing no matter what solution you provide to give those assurances and guarantees. but those assurances and guarantees must be provided in such a scenario to qualify as an adequate response. 

&#x200B;

in the scenario where ukraine fires an air defense missile in self defense that tragically malfunctions, the likely response that's seen as adequate is covering the incident with a blanket of understanding, and ensuring ukraine doesn't have to rely on shitty faulty malfunctioning russian made air defense systems in the future, so that another incident like this will be prevented that way.

&#x200B;

i'm not gonna tell you what's right or wrong, i don't have acces to all the information surrounding this event. neither do you. and i'd be surprised if nato or the USA itself actually has radar tracks that confirm beyond a shadow of a doubt where the missile originated from. and even if they do, it could still very well be a ukrainian s-300 missile that intercepted a russian cruise missile in just the right way where the s-300 exploded near enough to a russian cruise missile to knock it out of the sky but the warhead still detonated on impact. 

&#x200B;

we just don't know. and wether we'll ever know is in the hands of the parties investigating the incident and the evidence they supply. what i will tell you, is without final conclusions of the investigation, it's too early for people like you and i to draw conclusions yet.

&#x200B;

personally, i've got faith in ukraine, ukraines leadership and command structure. i'm inclinded to believe zelensky if he says his air force and zaluzhny himself reported that it was not an ukrainian missile. though, it should be noted that zelensky also stated to accept the outcome of the investigation and if it does turn out to have been an ukrainian missile, ukraine will formally appologise to poland and pay reperations for the damage done."

Back in March/April when John Kirby was still the Spox for the Pentagon, he remarked about how the Pentagon specifically setup a ""deconfliction line"" that allowed lower level staff outside of the political leadership to communicate about non-political issues or more importantly issues that require immediate attention such as this.

During this time period reporters would ask him about it and he'd indicate that the US would ring up Russia every month or so just to make sure the line was working. Literally all they needed was a ""Yup, still working"" but it was clear from the DoD Spox's responses that Russia didn't answer most of the time, though it was clearly working because it would indeed ring and when the Russians did pick up they wouldn't complain about anything wrong.

I took it to mean that the Russians see even these low level tasks as an opportunity for a political show. It's more of an opportunity to brag or even impress managers about how they were able to ignore the ""stupid Americans""."

I can give you one recent example that resulted in shitload of unnecessary deaths - Covid.  
  
Obviously covid itself has nothing to do with Russia. But did they use the soft power to damage the EU and western countries? Absolutely.   
  
They run huge campaigns to promote stupid stuff like anti-vaxing, refusal to use masks etc. All of that indirectly killed actual, real people, by influencing those stupid enough to buy into all that, who spread covid like idiots.

And this is just one recent example we can actually look at.  
 
Just think about it - people are buying bullshit about EU government trying to cripple or kill them with vaccines, or masks being restriction on their freedom! 40 years ago anyone saying stuff like that would be considered insane nutjob by everyone around them.  
  
What happens if there is something EVEN WORSE than Covid, and Russia manages to use their propaganda to sabotage EU to the degree in which it gets so out of hand, that EU simply collapses due to plague? You don't think that something like that is indirect waging of war? The intent is pretty clear to anyone who can see the situation from the side, I have no clue how EU citizens are still blind to this.

It takes a lot of additional infrastructure, material, produ tion space, component inventory, workers, etc., to spool up production. Most of all it takes time and money. Money Congress has to apportion: This takes time.

Ramping production from the 10's per month to the hundreds/thousands needed, if the funding and logistics is in place, will take anywhere from 6 months to two years!

In March people said that it would take multiple months to prepare the supplies of modern tanks/planes/..., so it's better to stick to weapons from Warsaw Pact countries. Multiple months have already passed now. Progress on MBTs? 0%. Progress on planes? 0% (Ukraine chose pilots for training, but as far as I am aware, the bill for funding the fucking training is still stuck in US buraeucracy for months now).

Thank all existing gods that other countries finally got around on settling the primordial question of air defence - after Oct. 10 suddenly everyone realized that, in fact, air defense is mostly a ""defensive"" weapon (duh), and, in fact, Ukraine's cries from March ""ok you won't close the sky, but give us anti-air and wr will close our own sky"" might've been onto something - and so the question of Ukrainian air defense can finally be settled in a few more months!...

“Wednesday, however, saw a rapid soothing of tensions.”

“Both Poland and NATO issued statements characterizing the missile strike as a ""tragic accident"" after the ensuing investigation determined the missile was likely fired by Ukraine as it defended itself against a barrage of missile fire by invading Russian forces.”

“And Russia—which quickly sought to distance itself from the accidental strike Tuesday—had an unlikely ally to thank for averting crisis: Biden.”

Also, non-european people maybe miss the history behind it:

Until the year 1200 ac russian provinces developed according to northern-western europe. For example the province Novgorod was part of the [Hanse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanseatic_League)

This is mentioned in the video, but not everybody may know what it means for western european development.

It is similar of what happened later in Venezia (Venice) ... commerce always had a big impact on the development of civil rule and law, as it was carried out not by ""state actors"" but private people.

Anyway ...

Then, with the occupation of Russia by mongolian tribes from the east, a rather archaic rule establishes. These tribes did have no need for rule of law. It lasted for 300 years.

And this is a heritage until today, with a deep vertical hierarchy in the rule of the empire/state.

It also explains the corruption, because corruption is also mean of control over provinces ... as a ""substitute"" or ""in the absence"" of the rule of law.

They don't have the infrastructure to distribute palletized goods and military equipment. They also don't have enough quality tires to run a military, and they don't have the means to produce them domestically (tires are still made from natural rubber, which is produced from trees that only grow in more tropical areas). Another area that is causing huge issues (and will continue to for decades) is their lack of a domestic semiconductor industry. One of their major domestic producers, Angstrem, went bankrupt likely due to large-scale corruption. Their largest chip producer, Mikron, is so far behind that their chips can't even be used in modern smartphones but are instead limited to applications like credit card chips and RFID tags. Russia is entirely dependent on the outside world for technology (and many raw materials), to the point that they are royally fucked if they can't reenter the global economy in the next year."

Many standard (I do not know what a standard bridge is) bridges are restricted to a maximum of a 36 ton heavy load and for these special heavy loads you also need permission to do this. Simply put, an Abrams would not be allowed to cross these bridges.

Abrams are also not allow on paved roads as they would rip up the asphalt in a serious way.

So Ukraine, if they were to get these tanks, would need bridge layers to accompanying them, that can support 70 tons (aka the M104 Wolverine).

And if there is sufficient airstrip, a C-17 can transport an Abrams.

Just let you know the Leopard I (approx. 42 tons) can only cross 500-600 of Poland's bridges. One city itself, in Poland, has over 100 bridges."

If that was true Zelensky wouldn't have stated categorically that it was Russia the moment the news broke, and his Foreign Minister wouldn't have said it was ""russian propaganda"" to even speculate that it might have been a ukrainian anti-air missile.  This happened while every nato country ***was*** actually saying that it should be investigated before jumping to conclusions.

Now that he has egg on his face, Zelensky hasn't admitted he was wrong, he's demanded access to the site, to the evidence, and to the NATO meeting about the incident.  He's not waiting for evidence he's trying to insert himself in the investigation and decisions surrounding it to influence the outcome, and having been told he needs special approval for that, he has no other choice but to sit on his hands and wait, grudgingly saying he'll apologize if the decision comes down against him.

After hearing that NATO thinks it was his missiles, what leader would not be re-questioning his people and demanding accounting for every single piece of ordinance in an attempt to discern what might have gone wrong and who lied and covered up a mistake and made him look foolish, since he claims that his people told him it was not them.  Instead he just re-stated his previous claims that it wasn't them because his people told him so."

Good engeneering, but too expensive.

Within Germany the introduction of these trains was a desaster ...  
Financially and also practically.

They have a technology that makes it possible to ""lean into curves"".

This was a modern concept of the time of first generation development (1980/1990).

This will help with high speed in curves.

Turns out:

German railway tracks are built too close to each other.

There could be collisions with other trains coming from the opposite direction.

Also collision with signal poles in close range of the track.

Mostly this feature could not be used.  
One of the many reasons it is much slower than per specification.

He was referring to the Azov regiment: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azov_Regiment
Literal SS logo until 2015.

2. He called Donetsk a Russian-backed separatist uprising.
That's not entirely wrong. I'll grant you it's an incomplete picture, but since we're going off what someone says about what someone else says, this is not good enough proof to me. When Ukraine threw out the Russian puppets, Donetsk had more people who were supporters of the previous administration than anywhere else. Some of the Donetsk fighters are, quite sadly, true believers.

I don't agree that he is ""very pro russia"" on this basis. He might be, but this isn't proof. 

To my point above, I am able to acknowledge that some groups in Ukraine had a bit of a fascism problem. That doesn't AT ALL mean I think the invasion was justified, or that we shouldn't arm Ukraine to fight off the aggressor, or any of the other things that Kremlin propagandists *wish* it meant. But I can acknowledge the underlying reality regardless. I support Ukraine wholeheartedly; having a racist uncles regiment does not mean your civilians deserve to be slaughtered."

BUT if Ukraine's missile is responsible, then they need to own up to it and take responsibility because it's the right thing to do. All this strange skulduggery and Zelensky flatly opposing both NATO and Poland's view is...I don't know, it's just odd.

Everyone knows that if Russia hadn't invaded there would be no Ukrainian missiles in the air at all, but if Ukraine made a mistake then they still need to own up to it. If there was a malfunction from poor maintenance, human error, bad programming or whatever else, that resulted in a Ukrainian missile killing Polish citizens, Ukraine should admit it, offer condolences, and pay reparations to the families. When the US, fighting against tyranny and fascism, bombed neutral Switzerland by mistake in WW2, they didn't just say ""not our fault, blame Hitler."" They paid reparations (albeit several years later). Likewise West Germany paid reparations to Ireland (also neutral in WW2) because the Luftwaffe (who conversely were fighting FOR tyranny and fascism at the time) bombed Dublin several times. It's justice for the families, it's the right thing to do morally, and it will continue to strengthen the already overwhelming evidence that Ukraine are acting in a righteous way and are the clear good guys.

If it was a Russian missile of course, then the families of the dead will probably never get any kind of justice at all."

Considering Russia is a major fossil fuel exporter that solves the ""cheap energy"" part. And the fact that they control a giant landmass with fuck tons of natural resources would solve the ""capital"" part. Whatever natural resource they can't make they could buy.

Every other issue is their own fault. Even the concept of being out competed by another country in a certain industry doesn't hold water since any country that cares about a certain industry enough will take measures to keep it afloat. Like the United states right now trying to start up a semi conductor industry at home out of fear that Taiwan will be invaded by china therefore putting their semi conductor industry into the hands of the CCP. Russia is an example of being your own worst enemy.

Large countries with vast amounts of natural resources and the ability to feed hundreds of millions don't really have an excuse for being so pathetic. Look at all the other players on the world stage that share those features. You have India, the us, china, and maybe Brazil. And except for Brazil they are all either global powers or rising regional powers. Russia is a declining regional power. And India has to deal with the fact that all of its neighbors are imploding (Pakistan, sri lanka ). Meanwhile Russia is bordered by Europe, a non hostile continent that would more than willingly establish very lucrative trade with Russia."

2. Probably. That is their standard procedure. That and fight proxy wars.

3 key here is China. What will they do in the vacuum and how does that play out in 10,20 years. Is it real close ties or it’s slow takeover of resources in the region?

4 it will in nato influenced areas. But not in countries that don’t fight traditional wars like Afghanistan it doesn’t work. This was have been a full attrition battle.  First time forna while we had a fight in a country that is winnable and the people your recovering territory really want you there. Because it’s your troops.

I don’t disagree with any of this. Where they managed to fight back to we will see. But at some point the majority of fighting will end and lines drawn.

A strong-man type willing use military force to achieve goals or at least punish misbehavior can prevent a lot of other bad actors from doing the same.  

Under Trump, there was no escalation of the Ukraine war by Russia despite media peddling how he was in Putins pocket.  Trump ordered the bombing of a Russian occupied airbase in Syria in retaliation for crossing an Obama red line, killed the main Iranian General responsible for organizing many terrorist attacks in Iraq, and is one of the few U.S. presidents to have allowed U.S. forces to directly fire on and kill hundreds of Russian mercenaries.  The russian ""little green men"" that took over Crimea without insignia certainly weren't so bold after the U.S. killed hundreds of them in Syria.  There are good reasons and precedent to believe that Trumps eagerness to appear strong prevented the escalation of the Ukrainian conflict during his presidency.

As Americans, we like to think others think like us and if we're just reasonable and play nice, so will others.  But that is not the case, and many leaders around the world would order horrific acts if they did not fear retaliation.  An irrational strong man is not always a bad thing as long as there are proper guardrails.

I obviously do not know all the details or can connect all the dots to know specifically how history would have changed, but Clinton, Bush, and Obama all helped lead to this war by isolating Russia, exiting treaties and attempting to build anti-ballistic missile defense right on the Russian border, while at the same time continuously trying to expand NATO, long after the USSR was done.  I don't know if that was pushed by old school CIA because they still perceived a threat, but from my laymen view it seemed unnecessary.   There was no way Russia would accept NATO countries with anti-ballistic missiles right up on their border where they are most effective.  Trying to eliminate the local influence of a former super power while all the people from its superpower days are still around is not necessarily a rational, adult decision either.  Ukraine could have waited a decade to join NATO after the old Soviet guard passed, and a conflict of this scale may have been avoided."

It can hang out in safe areas and is basically a truck with gantry. The missile pods are manufactured elsewhere. Simply installed, then removed and replaced when empty. The most complex part is the training of its firing system.

A tank is an utterly different beast. So much more is required of its functionality at the front lines. It's going to see a lot more wear and tear than a truck driving in safer areas that will unlikely ever even receive gunfire while on mission. Russia has yet to destroy a single HIMARS. Tanks drive over *everything* their treads and grip. They fire dozens of rounds per mission which means having to load all that ammo every time. The gun itself will be care for that. They will receive fire of all levels from gunfire, RPG, and artillery. They require a fully trained crew that takes longer than HIMARS would. The tank treads getting clogged with everything they have to drive through because you don't get tidy roads on the front line. Not to mention its engine or the massive amounts of fuel necessary for the beast.

I'm not saying it couldn't be done but it's just not as anywhere near as simple as HIMARS. Like the other comment said logistics is a huge deal and a tank is going to need a lot more love, which is why Russia's awful logistics loses them so many of theirs. 

I want Ukraine to have everything the US can give them and more.

>No, you fucking Fascist moron, Reagan fucked America over economically, and accomplished shit with Russia. Carter was probably the worst Democrat to be president in my life, but had he beat Reagan, the USSR would still have fallen from their own incompetence.

Calm those tits bud, you don't have to get mad about written history.  Since apparently facist can be thrown around at anyone, YOU'RE the facist.  I was there behind the Iron curtain, we all knew the Russians were overspending on military at least in part because of Reagan's hostile stance and military build up.  The Reagan Doctrine was an intentional strategy to cripple a weakened USSR economically, it certainly contributed to their downfall as they tried to compete with the incredibly expensive development of next generation nuclear delivery and defense.  In the end, he forged a friendship with Gorbachev that helped push glastnost and the end of the USSR.

Estonia and Latvia are NATO countries and they are on Russia's doorstep and a lot closer to St. Petersburg compared to Ukraine. And a similar distance to Moscow. If NATO wanted to they could have put Ballistic Missiles in those countries. NATO however is a defensive pact and so they didn't take that action. You are basically repeating Russian propaganda. Putin's actions were a land grab, pure and simple. Plus Ukraine is a sovereign country and they should have the right to join any alliance they choose. Saying otherwise is agreeing with the dictators of the world.

1668674392.0,iwp6tpo,t5_30hhs,0,1,vegarig,0,"> Is it likely the Western powers would not help even if Ukraine didn't ask?

More of ""their definition of strategic win and Ukrainian definition of victory aren't completely aligned"".

For Western countries, keeping Ukrainian rear going and civilian casualties minimalized isn't as much of a pressing need as for Ukraine, as horrible as it is.

USA seems more interested in maximizing damage to russia, as [Lloyd Austin said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/04/25/russia-weakened-lloyd-austin-ukraine-visit/), than ensuring Ukrainian victory ASAP:

>“We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Austin said.

Plus, there's an embargo on supplying tanks, jets and long-range weaponry, as [Macron said:](https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/news/2022/06/16/7141437/)

>French President Emmanuel Macron said that due to fears of involvement in the war with Russia, Western countries had agreed not to provide Ukraine with certain weapons.

>According to European Truth, Macron said this during a conversation with journalists in Kyiv on Thursday.

>""We are helping Ukraine defend itself, ***but we are not going to war with Russia, so it has been agreed not to supply certain weapons - including assault planes or tanks***, and President Zelensky is aware of this agreement,"" he said.

>The French president added that the West instead provided Ukraine with ammunition and ""certain types of equipment.""

>""And now they have also started to supply (self-propelled artillery) Ceasar. This will allow Ukraine to be more mobile and destroy the enemy from a distance,"" Macron said.

>In May, the media learned from sources that the White House was negotiating with Ukraine restrictions on the use of American weapons, particularly for purposes deep within Russia.

>At the same time, US President Joe Biden said that the United States did not plan to provide Ukraine with missile systems capable of hitting targets in Russia.

>These reports came amid discussions on the supply of long-range systems to Ukraine, especially rocket-propelled grenade launchers.

>However, in the end, the United States approved the transfer to Ukraine of four HIMARS MLRS, which are due to arrive by the end of June

So... as for me, future doesn't look quite so bright."

I think we saw some of that playing out in the midterms where one might have expected poor economic conditions to be taken out on Biden, no red wave eventuated and the GOP only made very minor gains... probably not enough to stop most of the aid to Ukraine. 

Sure, women's health and a few other problems generated by the stacked and corrupt SCOTUS also influenced the results, but overall it's become apparent Trumps influence is in decline.

There is a theory that the revolution started when they aired the TV series Dallas on romanian national TV and everyone saw how rich the americans were, more of a joke.

The people in the 60s and 70s, the good ol times of Ceausescu's rule first of all many didn't even have TVs, they lived in the countryside and had to get on a waiting list for a few years to be able to buy a gas stove, for example. I guarantee those people didn't give a shit. And the people who were moved to the cities also couldn't complain, since it was a big upgrade and living conditions were ok. Shit started to hit the fan in the 80s and they would start rationing electricity and food, not even because they didn't have any, they had more than we do now, just because of Ceausescu's stupid idea of paying off his debt to the western countries (which he used to build the factories), because he didn't understand economics and wanted to be INDEPENDENT even of the west for political reasons.

Anyway I am not saying it was good, just rejecting the notion that it was a ""soviet puppet state"", and Ceausescu went away because he lost soviet support. It was not, it was much more like North Korea. Is North Korea a soviet puppet state? Well the soviets don't exist anymore but North Korea keeps chugging along.

India buys it's oil from wherever it can because we want to bridge the energy gap untill Green Hydrogen becomes cheap and scalable. So if you cannot understand India's diplomatic policies that's ok. Doesn't give you the right to demonize it based on it's attempt to protect itself and its citizens."

There is a theory that the revolution started when they aired the TV series Dallas on romanian national TV and everyone saw how rich the americans were, more of a joke.

The people in the 60s and 70s, the good ol times of Ceausescu's rule first of all many didn't even have TVs, they lived in the countryside and had to get on a waiting list for a few years to be able to buy a gas stove, for example. I guarantee those people didn't give a shit. And the people who were moved to the cities also couldn't complain, since it was a big upgrade and living conditions were ok. Shit started to hit the fan in the 80s and they would start rationing electricity and food, not even because they didn't have any, they had more than we do now, just because of Ceausescu's stupid idea of paying off his debt to the western countries (which he used to build the factories), because he didn't understand economics and wanted to be INDEPENDENT even of the west for political reasons.

Anyway I am not saying it was good, just rejecting the notion that it was a ""soviet puppet state"", and Ceausescu went away because he lost soviet support. It was not, it was much more like North Korea. Is North Korea a soviet puppet state? Well the soviets don't exist anymore but North Korea keeps chugging along.

Despite being the largest democracy of the world Ukraine has repeatedly voted against India getting veto power in the UN. Why? What has India ever done to Ukraine? Absolutely nothing.
India buys it's oil from wherever it can because we want to bridge the energy gap untill Green Hydrogen becomes cheap and scalable. So if you cannot understand India's diplomatic policies that's ok. Doesn't give you the right to demonize it based on it's attempt to protect itself and its citizens."

Genocide and/or enslavement was a common method for many ancient groups, it was about the only way they could guarantee that their enemies wouldn't come back a generation or two later and turn against them.

>Russia was able to take over Kaliningrad by expelling all the Germans after WW2.

Russia exiles native groups to prevent organized dissent, they've done it for hundreds of years, and they likely learned it from the Mongols. Today you'll notice that there's an entire Oblast for Jews in Manchuria and Kalmykia in southwestern Russia is full of ethnic Mongols. Russia has done the same to Ukrainians and they're doing it again."

There were some studies about Russia Blitzing just part of the Baltics, holding that area and threatening nuclear retaliation. The point is that if Russia gets any positive feedback from the war, him or his imperialist successor will try something, and it might be far more dangerous."

When the revolutions were starting he went to the soviets for support, trying to tell them to keep maintaining the status quo, like to invade the countries that had revolutions. They told him they didn't give a shit anymore and he's on his own, do whatever the fuck you want. He didn't care about the ideology, he just wanted some help to stay in power.

For the most part of its existence, the USSR had a big problem with countries becoming democratic and especially capitalistic, as long as you were following the ideology and maintained control over your country they were happy, they didn't care if you were a brutal dictator. In the 80s the USSR knew already for a very long time (like the 70s) that their model was flawed and tried to reform but didn't really know what to do about it, but in any case didn't care about preserving it."

Just to clarify the 3 mil votes are mostly old people and gipsies. Young population wants change. It is difficult to argue with our elderly since they are blinded by the state media and they think they know better. No matter how educated you are you are just a stupid kid in their eyes. As for the gipsies they vote for the party who pays more. I'm not angry with that 3 million people but I'm upset about the 1.5-2 million, who did not vote. They coud have changed the outcome. And this is partially because of the big coalition of the opposition. You could hear on the streats people stating ""I dont vote for the coalition because they have Jobbik or they have Ferenc Gyurcsány""  Also the coalition did not include far left (MKP) or far right (Mihazánk). Jobbik is not considered far right anymore since during the last cycle they got rid of their far right elements (Mihazánk was formed from it and got 6% of the votes). MSZP is not far left although they inherited some element of their political philosophy from the communist era, they are a socialdemocratic party. The other problem was that both Mihazánk ant the Two Tailed Dog party (a pirate party) campaigned actively against the coalition. So this is us now and I don't really know how we can restore our democracy on a democratic way."
