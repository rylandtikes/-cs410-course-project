Tbh I would have thought this would have been done a while ago it's war you company means less than the survival of the country
Only if he was called up?
We were intimidated till about May. Now we just don’t give a shit anymore.
Eventually it'll happen.

Bold of him to assume any mobiks will survive to return home.
"Opinion polls show Republican voters have cooled on aid to Ukraine, and statements by influential conservatives show the same. (Many still support aid, of course.) Aid will likely be less, slower, and a lower priority. 

Democrats have stayed united in their support of Ukraine, which is why Americans who support Ukraine should consider a vote for them at the federal level this cycle."
"They are good at diverting their own actions.

They're not good at a defensive front on the information war."
"Thanks for this message. I appreciate the added perspective.

I'd also like to point out that their emigration issues will only worsen as the effects of sanctions further cripple their economy. There's been a lot of talk about the brain-drain that is happening and it's clear that there will be knock-on effects from this war that will only accelerate the loss of educated males from their population.

Without a high level of immigration from highly educated countries, Russia will never be able to create the infrastructure to build jobs and factories that are needed to keep educated people in their country. It's sort of a catch-22, where they really needed to focus on bringing in resources and expertise from the West, but they would have to allow Western influence in to accomplish that goal. They can't even train new people to restore what they've lost.

Basically, Russia is doomed to die of a very slow degradation over the next few decades. Eventually, their government will collapse again, but it will most likely just devolve into an even worse military controlled dictatorship. IE: a new North Korea."
"It's obvious that Ukraine has to become the strongest European country militarily, out of necessity. Russia won't leave it alone."
yeah i am racking my brain to think of a dictator who was able to make the transition from evil dictator to suburban family man.... none come to mind!

"She says if asked or needed... does not say **I wil**l send him. When in fact, the son can go and volunteer now. fake patriotism"
The girl in Blue is AGAINST the war- she is talking to another lady who is saying that...
"One reason Russia must continue is that if the war is ended, the truth will come out at home when all of these KIA Russian soldiers do not come home. Putin is riding the tiger - he must win, or at least delay losing."
It's obvious to anyone who can think for themselves.
"Those all make sense, for the bare minimum conditions at least."
"With winter coming, it may be best to lay siege to Kherson and let the Russians get demoralized."
🤣
"No, the young woman is the sane one. The old one is out of the frame and they are talking.

"Looking at home a country a quarter their size is kicking their ass. Yes. I do. It would take a week to destroy everything meaningful in Russia, then just leave them to freeze and starve in the dark, like they plan to do to Ukraine."
"Pretty much impossible to run such an election. When Russia seized the territories, most Ukrainians fled or were displaced, and many Russian colonists moved in.

Majority of Donbas [were ethnic Ukrainians in the 2001 census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donbas#Demographics_and_politics). All those regions voted to be part of Ukraine when it became independent from Soviet Union in 1991, and nothing about the catastrophe for Donbas that has been Russian rule suggests they would want to stay part of Russia now.

And finally, Russia should not be rewarded for their fascist conquests with the opportunity to retain any of their ill-gotten gains."
"Ooof. I mean, you  tried your best. There's that, I guess."
"**Donbas**

 >According to the 2001 census, ethnic Ukrainians form 58% of the population of Luhansk Oblast and 56. 9% of Donetsk Oblast. Ethnic Russians form the largest minority, accounting for 39% and 38. 2% of the two oblasts respectively.

"Let's say you live in a house with your family, and there are 5 of you. Then I conduct an armed break in of your house, throw two of your family members out, replace them with two people of mine, and hold a vote in the house while I have armed guards standing around the remaining three members of your family. Don't allow any third parties to monitor the vote or counting.

And then I claim ""80% of people currently residing in this house vote that it now belongs to me, so it is mine"".

Would you be accepting this situation?

Because it's an extremely apt analogy for what happened in those illegally annexed Ukrainian regions."
Putin's balls on a platter would be a good addition
They have literally no conceptual understanding of what war is beyond what their propaganda tells them. So you have to forgive their childish ignorance. This is why education is so important.
"You usage of “white Christian” in this derogatory way is so very racist.  In care you don’t realize it, now you know"
"See, I think you’re right, and I can’t logically argue against much of anything you said (except that Russia should look east, since the proposition of adding Slavs would be more appealing to Russia). 

But the problem is precisely that you’re thinking logically. Russia — and Putin — are not logical actors. If they were, they’d use their Petrino-economy to diversify their economy and develop their nation and count their resources as a blessing. That’s not what they do. 

Of course to YOU Ukraine doesn’t have enough natural resources to interest you in invading Ukraine. But Putin is a de facto mob boss, because Russia even at the state level is a de facto criminal organization. This is similar to how poor or even middle class people wonder how rich people are constantly looking to make $2 billion dollars when they already have a $1 billion. “Why would you need that much money?” They don’t. But billionaires don’t think like average people. That’s why they’re billionaires. This is even truer of criminals, right? If you’re a drug kingpin and you make $500,000,000 shipping cocaine around the world, you would *think* that the smartest move would be to check out and fuck off to somewhere to retire. Instead, that same drug lord will attempt to overtake the resources of an organization that makes $100,000,000 in a year. Why risk everything to take over a rival that makes 1/5th the money you do? That’s daft. They do it because they suffer from the psychosis of Uber rich and criminals. That’s what Putin is. 

I just think that the guy simply couldn’t stand the idea of an independent, growing, developing nation of Slavs that benefit from an economy integrated with Europe and from resources that could be Russian. And adding Ukrainians to the Russian population — even if illogical compared to, say, Kazakhstan, since Kazakhstan is full of dirty non-Russians. 

And this is where the problem lies with assessing true motives. Russia is not a logical actor."
You know I really don't see a reason why Russian cannon folder necessarily has to have a penis.

">It demonstrates that western media still doesn't have a clue how ruthless the Russian government is

Well, this is just an opinion piece. Hopefully the western politicans and businesses have already got a clue about what Russia and the russian government is , and what the right approach for them is. I'll be extremely disappointed in life if they start making steps towards restoring all business relations with Russia immediately after the war

&#x200B;

>He knows that almost no-one, including the West, will even remember how crazy all this shit was in a years time.

It's more like - he knows that his population doesn't care at all what the West thinks, on the contrary, many people are glad to act in a way that upsets ""the decadent west"". And, other than the West, there are no rivals to Russia, the greatest country in the world, so why should russians even care about anything that a non-russian thinks in general? Propaganda is one hell of a drug, especially if you are subjected to it not for 8 years, not for 30 years, not for 80 years, but for literal hundreds of years, in various form

I'm not entirely sold on similarities to Trump, though, something here just seems wrong to me. To me, right now, the word ""Trump"" is synonimous with ""clown"", and the word ""Putin/Medvedev/\[insert rus.official\]"" - with ""malice"". They all could say literally the same things, but while Trump says what he says mostly for his own benefit, Putin and his company's endgame with these statements is annexation and genocide, even if the statement itself seems to be rational."
"Its cheaper to store it and keep it then to destroy it. Also artillery shells are fairly shelf stable if stored correctly. To give you an idea, i fired rounds made in the 70s and 80s of 155mm in the 2010s in combat."
"""Special forces"" means more than two weeks of training (no literacy required), so you are probably ""right""."
That's not going to stop the mob.

It’s the loss of pilots that hurts the most.
"I'd say Trump is less pro-russia and more anti-theguywhodidn'tbowdownandkisshisringwhenhetriedtoextorthimtogetdirtonbiden. In the end, it's probably both but Trump's personal vendetta's will always take top priority."

"You can't just claim people from another country want to be a part of Russia, carve it out and annex it, and let the ""voters"" decide after you invaded it.

Literally none of that makes sense."
"I think China has already lost. It's given the West a blueprint if they ever move on Taiwan that would cripple the Chinese economy. It's also strengthened NATO and the EU to a point that would've seemed like a pipe dream a year ago, which is definitely not a benefit for China. There's also no way China invades Russia to take land, Russia has no many nukes that no one is going to invade it. 

The only way China, and Russia for that matter, could've won is if Russia actually completed the 3 day war everyone expected. That way NATO doesnt get stronger, nations don't rally to support Ukraine with sanctions and aid, and the West doesn't unify. Russia then keeps it's aura of strength and NATO attention is diverted to the extreme to Russia and a Russia/China partnership seems so much stronger."
So you’re telling me I got a chance...aalllrirrrght.
I guess Russian POV just means something different to me.
"They started to do this with ventilators as recently as early COVID, IIRC."
Ok but why was the ukrainian govt shelling its own former citizens in regions that voted to become part of russia?
"Unfortunately, this is an asymmetric war.  


Russia does not mind committing a few thousand war crimes and bomb civilians and infra structure. They are quite happy to render most of Ukraine unliveable. While Ukraine seems to hold back with attacking Russia itself and resigns itself to defending its own space.  


In other words: All the military successes Ukraine has at the moment will matter little, if Russians level Ukrainian cities. Which they will.  


In the short run, the criminals and the swines always win. Whether there is a 'long run' remains to be seen."
"That makes no sense. What makes you think that?

Any source or opinion piece or anything?

If it’s just your personal opinion that’s cool too.

Thanks for responding genuinely."
Or a yam maybe!!
"there's barely anything we could do to change that. Sending conventional forces in the direction of Moscow is off the table for anyone with a sliver of sanity. Russia can't receive Germany's treatment and radically reform its society for the better, because that would require a complete demilitarization and collapse of the state, with quick establishment of firm external control, and I'm not sure that's happening

Reparations will help restore the economy, though :) slowly but surely. There's nothing on this Earth that would mitigate the pain of those who have lost relatives and friends to the war, but the only way to make russians feel similar pain would be to bomb them into oblivion - and even that will bring nothing but more pain and misery into the world, and will completely justify russians' biases against the west. (not that any of it matters, but the overall point is that aggression inside of their territory is just straight-up pointless)"
"> I bet they don’t even get sanctions for using them

The other way of looking at it is that they are already being sanctioned at or above the level that CS gas use would result in?"
"No there won't!

Putin is a narcissist.  He has tied this war to his self-worth.

I guaran-fucking-tee you if Putin pulled every Russian grunt out of Ukraine from Donbas to Crimea tomorrow, not one fucking negative thing would happen to him.

This has nothing to do with Russia's status (Putin's already fucked that up) and everything to do with *Putin's* status.

He's in a dick measuring contest with the West.

He tried the clever route by fucking with elections, had some success, and got overconfident and tried to use real military power, which he doesn't have.

He should have stuck to the cloak-and-dagger shit.

But he can't cut his losses now.

He's going to Stay The Course.

Americans have been through this before."

"Honestly, I think many people are scratching their heads trying to understand what this was truly about. But without getting into a political conversation and talking geopolitical issues, I would hope any sane person can agree that a ruthless invasion that kills your family, your neighbours, and all of your loved ones shouldn’t be decided by a simple vote. That’s literally like saying a mob of folks can roll up to whatever place you personally call home and do whatever they want and then say let those mob(s) vote on how things should go from now on."
"Are you referencing the 1,300 terminals that went offline? Those were donated by a British company, but they couldn’t continue payments for the service so the terminals were switched out before it caused issues. The MoD also declined to assist in paying for the service.

"> Now it is to late for concessions from Ukraine, because the damage that everyone wanted to avoid already happened. Concessions were offered to avoid this war. Russians continued the war anyway, so concessions became pointless.

A good point imo - it reminds me of the stuff William Spaniel on YouTube has been saying, about the various costs of different outcomes for either side and it being a matter of what they think they can realistically achieve via continuing to fight vs negotiating.

One of his earlier videos on the subject - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JR8vDyWE8k"
It's important to remember that there is the Iranian Army and the IRGC and that that the Mullahs' government is primarily protected by the IRGC which are 100% to the death hardliners. The religious dictatorship built it this way to protect themselves even better.
So true. Like these countries give a shit about our laws.

"Nazi germany was a nation state scale economic ponzi scheme, which was going to run out of money by the end of 1939 and fall apart in the early 40s.   Its like many right and left wing authoritarian economic miracles, ie production increases, but its all underpinned by unsustainable practices which cause more unsustainable practices to be undertaken to keep the wheels turning.

The timetable for war was set by the necessity of capturing foreign nations capital reserves, which is the ultimate unsustainable economic practice.

By 1935 the reich labour service was force conscripting german workers at unemployment benefit payscales for national projects (initially for 6 months, and once the war started that became never ending for most german conscript workers and work forces in conquered nations.

That of course directed labor to unproductive national projects and deprived most of the population of any chance of acquiring base capital for small scale private projects, as well as making a small pool of industrialists extremely rich.   (when only a few people have all the capital, they apply it to very few ideas).

There are of course parallels with modern Russia, which may become more stark if they can't reestablish energy exports to wealthy european markets."
"TikTok is created by a private company in China; the Chinese government has a pretty tight grip over private companies in China. It may sound like I'm splitting hairs, but the Chinese government didn't create TikTok, and I'm sure they can't even if they wanted to.

BTW, China has its own version of TikTok, Douyin, created by the same company. IIRC it's no less of a cesspool.

Does the Chinese government has an interest in destablizing democarcies? Certainly. Are TikTok along with other social media sites convenient tools? Of course."
"Maybe not fun later after it sinks in, but in past wars I've seen soldiers joke about all the enemy they've been killing. A fighter pilot who said he would dive on ground troops and ""hose 'em down,"" and one guy who was tagging artillery targets with a laser literally saying it was like a video game. I'm sure remote targeting makes it much easier to ignore the enemy's humanity than face-to-face combat."
"Mobiks are the mobilized people who are conscripts to the russian army. They’re generally normal civilians, most of which have completed their mandatory service in the military (although this is not necessarily the case for everyone currently). 

Muscovites are the people who are generally white in appearance,  slavs, from the Moscow region. What you gotta realize is that “russia” is actually a large conglomerate of conquered peoples and territory that encompasses about 25% of the world. There is actually no reason these other ethnic groups are together… other than they have taken over areas, and moved the people that live there thousands of kilometers away. Combine that with moving“russians” in to both repopulate and maintain rule….and claim that it’s theirs. Muscovites are cancer."
